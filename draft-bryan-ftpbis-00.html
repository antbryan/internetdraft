Introduction</h3>

<p>
   The objectives of FTP are 1) to promote sharing of files (computer
   programs and/or data), 2) to encourage indirect or implicit (via
   programs) use of remote computers, 3) to shield a user from
   variations in file storage systems among hosts, and 4) to transfer
   data reliably and efficiently.  FTP, though usable directly by a user
   at a terminal, is designed mainly for use by programs.

</p>
<p>
   The attempt in this specification is to satisfy the diverse needs of
   users of maxi-hosts, mini-hosts, personal workstations, and TACs,
   with a simple, and easily implemented protocol design.

</p>
<p>
   This paper assumes knowledge of the Transmission Control Protocol
   (TCP) <a class='info' href='#RFC0793'>[RFC0793]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J., &ldquo;Transmission Control Protocol,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1981.</span><span>)</span></a> and the Telnet Protocol <a class='info' href='#RFC0854'>[RFC0854]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J. and J. Reynolds, &ldquo;Telnet Protocol Specification,&rdquo; May&nbsp;1983.</span><span>)</span></a>.  These documents are contained
   in the ARPA-Internet protocol handbook <a class='info' href='#IPTW'>[IPTW]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Feinler, E., &ldquo;Internet Protocol Transition Workbook,&rdquo; March&nbsp;1982.</span><span>)</span></a>.

Document Conventions and Overview</h3>

<p>This specification describes conformance of the File Transfer Protocol (FTP).
</p>
<p>
   In this section, the history, the terminology, and the FTP model are
   discussed.  The terms defined in this section are only those that
   have special significance in FTP.  Some of the terminology is very
   specific to the FTP model; some readers may wish to turn to the
   section on the FTP model (<a class='info' href='#sec-2.3'>Section&nbsp;2.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Times</span><span>)</span></a>) while reviewing the terminology.

</p>
<p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
	"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
	document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, <a class='info' href='#RFC2119'>[RFC2119]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bradner, S., &ldquo;Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels,&rdquo; March&nbsp;1997.</span><span>)</span></a>, as scoped to those conformance targets.
</p>
<p>Syntax required is defined using the Augmented BNF defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC5234'>[RFC5234]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Crocker, D. and P. Overell, &ldquo;Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>.

Basic Tokens</h3>

<p>
   This document imports the core ABNF definitions given in Appendix B
   of <a class='info' href='#RFC5234'>[RFC5234]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Crocker, D. and P. Overell, &ldquo;Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>.  There definitions will be found for basic ABNF elements like

     SCHAR          = RCHAR / "=" ;
</pre></div><p>


</p>
<p>
   The VCHAR (from <a class='info' href='#RFC5234'>[RFC5234]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Crocker, D. and P. Overell, &ldquo;Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>), RCHAR, SCHAR, and TCHAR types give basic
   character types from varying sub-sets of the ASCII character set for
   use in various commands and responses.

</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
      token          = 1*RCHAR
</pre></div><p>


</p>
<p>
   A &quot;token&quot; is a string whose precise meaning depends upon the context
   in which it is used.  In some cases it will be a value from a set of
   possible values maintained elsewhere.  In others it might be a string
   invented by one party to an FTP conversation from whatever sources it
   finds relevant.

</p>
<p>
   Note that in ABNF, string literals are case insensitive.  That
   convention is preserved in this document, and implies that FTP
   commands added by this specification have names that can be
   represented in any case.  That is, &quot;MDTM&quot; is the same as &quot;mdtm&quot;,
   &quot;Mdtm&quot; and &quot;MdTm&quot; etc.  However note that ALPHA, in particular, is
   case sensitive.  That implies that a &quot;token&quot; is a case sensitive
   value.  That implication is correct, except where explicitly stated
   to the contrary in this document, or in some other specification that
   defines the values this document specifies be used in a particular
   context.

<a name="rfc.section.2.2"></a><h3>2.2.&nbsp;
Pathnames</h3>

<p>
   Various FTP commands take pathnames as arguments, or return pathnames
   in responses.  When the MLST command is supported, as indicated in
   the response to the FEAT command <a class='info' href='#RFC2389'>[RFC2389]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hethmon, P. and R. Elz, &ldquo;Feature negotiation mechanism for the File Transfer Protocol,&rdquo; August&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a>, pathnames are to be transferred
   in one of the following two formats.

</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
     pathname       = utf-8-name / raw
     utf-8-name     = &lt;a UTF-8 encoded Unicode string&gt;
     raw            = &lt;any string that is not a valid UTF-8 encoding&gt;
</pre></div><p>


</p>
<p>
   Which format is used is at the option of the user-PI or server-PI
   sending the pathname.  UTF-8 encodings [2] contain enough internal
   structure that it is always, in practice, possible to determine
   whether a UTF-8 or raw encoding has been used, in those cases where
   it matters.  While it is useful for the user-PI to be able to
   correctly display a pathname received from the server-PI to the user,
   it is far more important for the user-PI to be able to retain and
   retransmit the identical pathname when required.  Implementations are
   advised against converting a UTF-8 pathname to a local charset that
   isn't capable of representing the full Unicode character repertoire,
   and then attempting to invert the charset translation later.  Note
   that ASCII is a subset of UTF-8.  See also [1].

</p>
<p>
   Unless otherwise specified, the pathname is terminated by the CRLF
   that terminates the FTP command, or by the CRLF that ends a reply.
   Any trailing spaces preceding that CRLF form part of the name.
   Exactly one space will precede the pathname and serve as a separator
   from the preceding syntax element.  Any additional spaces form part
   of the pathname.  See <a class='info' href='#RFC2640'>[RFC2640]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Curtin, B., &ldquo;Internationalization of the File Transfer Protocol,&rdquo; July&nbsp;1999.</span><span>)</span></a> for a fuller explanation of the character
   encoding issues.  All implementations supporting MLST MUST support
   <a class='info' href='#RFC2640'>[RFC2640]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Curtin, B., &ldquo;Internationalization of the File Transfer Protocol,&rdquo; July&nbsp;1999.</span><span>)</span></a>.

</p>
<p>
   Note: for pathnames transferred over a data connection, there is no
   way to represent a pathname containing the characters CR and LF in
   sequence, and distinguish that from the end of line indication.
   Hence, pathnames containing the CRLF pair of characters cannot be
   transmitted over a data connection.  Data connections only contain
   file names transmitted from server-FTP to user-FTP as the result of
   one of the directory listing commands.  Files with names containing
   the CRLF sequence must either have that sequence converted to some
   other form, such that the other form can be recognised and be
   correctly converted back to CRLF, or be omitted from the listing.

</p>
<p>
   Implementations should also beware that the FTP control connection
   uses Telnet NVT conventions <a class='info' href='#RFC0854'>[RFC0854]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J. and J. Reynolds, &ldquo;Telnet Protocol Specification,&rdquo; May&nbsp;1983.</span><span>)</span></a>, and that the Telnet IAC character,
   if part of a pathname sent over the control connection, MUST be
   correctly escaped as defined by the Telnet protocol.

</p>
<p>
   NVT also distinguishes between CR, LF, and the end of line CRLF, and
   so would permit pathnames containing the pair of characters CR and LF
   to be correctly transmitted.  However, because such a sequence cannot
   be transmitted over a data connection (as part of the result of a
   LIST, NLST, or MLSD command), such pathnames are best avoided.

</p>
<p>
   Implementors should also be aware that, although Telnet NVT
   conventions are used over the control connections, Telnet option
   negotiation MUST NOT be attempted.  See <a class='info' href='#sec-5.2'>Section&nbsp;5.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Connections</span><span>)</span></a>.

Pathname Syntax</h3>

   Except where TVFS is supported (see <a class='info' href='#tvfs'>Section&nbsp;4.1.5.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>A Trivial Virtual File Store (TVFS)</span><span>)</span></a>), this specification
   imposes no syntax upon pathnames.  Nor does it restrict the character
   set from which pathnames are created.  This does not imply that the
   NVFS is required to make sense of all possible pathnames.  Server-PIs
   may restrict the syntax of valid pathnames in their NVFS in any
   manner appropriate to their implementation or underlying file system.
   Similarly, a server-PI may parse the pathname and assign meaning to
   the components detected.

<a name="rfc.section.2.2.2"></a><h3>2.2.2.&nbsp;
Wildcarding</h3>

<p>
   For the commands defined in this specification, all pathnames are to
   be treated literally.  That is, for a pathname given as a parameter
   to a command, the file whose name is identical to the pathname given
   is implied.  No characters from the pathname may be treated as
   special or &quot;magic&quot;, thus no pattern matching (other than for exact
   equality) between the pathname given and the files present in the
   NVFS of the server-FTP is permitted.

</p>
<p>
   Clients that desire some form of pattern matching functionality must
   obtain a listing of the relevant directory, or directories, and
   implement their own file name selection procedures.

<a name="rfc.section.2.3"></a><h3>2.3.&nbsp;
Times</h3>

<p>
   The syntax of a time value is:

</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
      time-val       = 14DIGIT [ "." 1*DIGIT ]
</pre></div><p>


</p>
<p>
   The leading, mandatory, fourteen digits are to be interpreted as, in
   order from the leftmost, four digits giving the year, with a range of
   1000--9999, two digits giving the month of the year, with a range of
   01--12, two digits giving the day of the month, with a range of
   01--31, two digits giving the hour of the day, with a range of
   00--23, two digits giving minutes past the hour, with a range of
   00--59, and finally, two digits giving seconds past the minute, with
   a range of 00--60 (with 60 being used only at a leap second).  Years
   in the tenth century, and earlier, cannot be expressed.  This is not
   considered a serious defect of the protocol.

</p>
<p>
   The optional digits, which are preceded by a period, give decimal
   fractions of a second.  These may be given to whatever precision is
   appropriate to the circumstance, however implementations MUST NOT add
   precision to time-vals where that precision does not exist in the
   underlying value being transmitted.

</p>
<p>
   Symbolically, a time-val may be viewed as

</p>
<p>
      YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.sss

</p>
<p>
   The &quot;.&quot; and subsequent digits (&quot;sss&quot;) are optional.  However the &quot;.&quot;
   MUST NOT appear unless at least one following digit also appears.

</p>
<p>
   Time values are always represented in UTC (GMT), and in the Gregorian
   calendar regardless of what calendar may have been in use at the date
   and time indicated at the location of the server-PI.

</p>
<p>
   The technical differences among GMT, TAI, UTC, UT1, UT2, etc., are
   not considered here.  A server-FTP process should always use the same
   time reference, so the times it returns will be consistent.  Clients
   are not expected to be time synchronized with the server, so the
   possible difference in times that might be reported by the different
   time standards is not considered important.

Server Replies</h3>

      error-code     = ("4" / "5") 2DIGIT
</pre></div><p>


</p>
<p>
   Implementors should note that the ABNF syntax used in this document
   and in other FTP related documents (but not used in <a class='info' href='#RFC0959'>[RFC0959]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J. and J. Reynolds, &ldquo;File Transfer Protocol,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1985.</span><span>)</span></a>), sometimes
   shows replies using the one-line format.  Unless otherwise explicitly
   stated, that is not intended to imply that multi-line responses are
   not permitted.  Implementors should assume that, unless stated to the
   contrary, any reply to any FTP command (including QUIT) may use the
   multi-line format described in <a class='info' href='#sec-4.2'>Section&nbsp;4.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>FTP Replies</span><span>)</span></a>.

</p>
<p>
   Throughout this document, replies will be identified by the three
   digit code that is their first element.  Thus the term &quot;500 reply&quot;
   means a reply from the server-PI using the three digit code &quot;500&quot;.

   In the examples of FTP dialogs presented in this document, lines that

   the server-PI, lines that begin &quot;S&gt; &quot; were sent over the control
   connection from the server-PI to the user-PI, and each sequence of
   lines that begin &quot;D&gt; &quot; was sent from the server-PI to the user-PI
   over a data connection created just to send those lines and closed
   immediately after.  No examples here show data transferred over a
   data connection from the client to the server.  In all cases, the
   prefixes shown above, including the one space, have been added for
   the purposes of this document, and are not a part of the data
   exchanged between client and server.

<a name="rfc.section.2.6"></a><h3>2.6.&nbsp;
History</h3>

<p>
      FTP has had a long evolution over the years.  <a class='info' href='#Appendix-C'>Appendix&nbsp;C<span> (</span><span class='info'>RFCs on FTP</span><span>)</span></a> is a
      chronological compilation of Request for Comments documents
      relating to FTP.  These include the first proposed file transfer
      mechanisms in 1971 that were developed for implementation on hosts
      at M.I.T. (RFC 114), plus comments and discussion in RFC 141.

</p>
<p>
      RFC 172 provided a user-level oriented protocol for file transfer
      between host computers (including terminal IMPs).  A revision of
      this as RFC 265, restated FTP for additional review, while RFC 281
      suggested further changes.  The use of a &quot;Set Data Type&quot;
      transaction was proposed in RFC 294 in January 1972.

</p>
<p>
      RFC 354 obsoleted RFCs 264 and 265.  The File Transfer Protocol
      was now defined as a protocol for file transfer between HOSTs on
      the ARPANET, with the primary function of FTP defined as
      transfering files efficiently and reliably among hosts and
      allowing the convenient use of remote file storage capabilities.
      RFC 385 further commented on errors, emphasis points, and
      additions to the protocol, while RFC 414 provided a status report
      on the working server and user FTPs.  RFC 430, issued in 1973,
      (among other RFCs too numerous to mention) presented further
      comments on FTP.  Finally, an &quot;official&quot; FTP document was
      published as RFC 454.

</p>
<p>
      By July 1973, considerable changes from the last versions of FTP
      were made, but the general structure remained the same.  RFC 542
      was published as a new &quot;official&quot; specification to reflect these
      changes.  However, many implementations based on the older
      specification were not updated.

</p>
<p>
      In 1974, RFCs 607 and 614 continued comments on FTP.  RFC 624
      proposed further design changes and minor modifications.  In 1975,
      RFC 686 entitled, &quot;Leaving Well Enough Alone&quot;, discussed the
      differences between all of the early and later versions of FTP.
      RFC 691 presented a minor revision of RFC 686, regarding the
      subject of print files.

</p>
<p>
      Motivated by the transition from the NCP to the TCP as the
      underlying protocol, a phoenix was born out of all of the above
      efforts in RFC 765 as the specification of FTP for use on TCP.

</p>
<p>In 1985, <a class='info' href='#RFC0959'>[RFC0959]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J. and J. Reynolds, &ldquo;File Transfer Protocol,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1985.</span><span>)</span></a> added the following optional commands to FTP:

      CDUP (Change to Parent Directory), SMNT (Structure Mount), STOU
      (Store Unique), RMD (Remove Directory), MKD (Make Directory), PWD
      (Print Directory), and SYST (System).

      NOTES: 1. The data connection may be used in either direction.
             2. The data connection need not exist all of the time.

                      Figure 1  Model for FTP Use
</pre></div><p>


</p>
<p>
      In the model described in Figure 1, the user-protocol interpreter
      initiates the control connection.  The control connection follows
      the Telnet protocol.  At the initiation of the user, standard FTP
      commands are generated by the user-PI and transmitted to the
      server process via the control connection.  (The user may
      establish a direct control connection to the server-FTP, from a
      TAC terminal for example, and generate standard FTP commands
      independently, bypassing the user-FTP process.) Standard replies
      are sent from the server-PI to the user-PI over the control
      connection in response to the commands.

</p>
<p>
      The FTP commands specify the parameters for the data connection
      (data port, transfer mode, representation type, and structure) and
      the nature of file system operation (store, retrieve, append,
      delete, etc.).  The user-DTP or its designate should &quot;listen&quot; on
      the specified data port, and the server initiate the data
      connection and data transfer in accordance with the specified
      parameters.  It should be noted that the data port need not be in
      the same host that initiates the FTP commands via the control
      connection, but the user or the user-FTP process must ensure a
      &quot;listen&quot; on the specified data port.  It ought to also be noted
      that the data connection may be used for simultaneous sending and
      receiving.

</p>
<p>
      In another situation a user might wish to transfer files between
      two hosts, neither of which is a local host. The user sets up
      control connections to the two servers and then arranges for a
      data connection between them.  In this manner, control information
      is passed to the user-PI but data is transferred between the
      server data transfer processes.  Following is a model of this
      server-server interaction.

</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>

                    Control     ------------   Control

                                 Figure 2
</pre></div><p>


</p>
<p>
      The protocol requires that the control connections be open while
      data transfer is in progress.  It is the responsibility of the
      user to request the closing of the control connections when
      finished using the FTP service, while it is the server who takes
      the action.  The server may abort data transfer if the control
      connections are closed without command.

</p>
<p>
      The Relationship between FTP and Telnet:
</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
         The FTP uses the Telnet protocol on the control connection.
         This can be achieved in two ways: first, the user-PI or the
         server-PI may implement the rules of the Telnet Protocol
         directly in their own procedures; or, second, the user-PI or
         the server-PI may make use of the existing Telnet module in the
         system.

</p>
<p>
         Ease of implementaion, sharing code, and modular programming
         argue for the second approach.  Efficiency and independence
         argue for the first approach.  In practice, FTP relies on very
         little of the Telnet Protocol, so the first approach does not
         necessarily involve a large amount of code.

Data Transfer Functions</h3>

<p>
   Files are transferred only via the data connection.  The control
   connection is used for the transfer of commands, which describe the
   functions to be performed, and the replies to these commands (see <a class='info' href='#sec-4.2'>Section&nbsp;4.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>FTP Replies</span><span>)</span></a>).  Several commands are concerned with the
   transfer of data between hosts.  These data transfer commands include
   the MODE command which specify how the bits of the data are to be
   transmitted, and the STRUcture and TYPE commands, which are used to
   define the way in which the data are to be represented.  The
   transmission and representation are basically independent but the
   &quot;Stream&quot; transmission mode is dependent on the file structure
   attribute and if &quot;Compressed&quot; transmission mode is used, the nature
   of the filler byte depends on the representation type.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1"></a><h3>3.1.&nbsp;
Data Representation and Storage</h3>

<p>
      Data is transferred from a storage device in the sending host to a
      storage device in the receiving host.  Often it is necessary to
      perform certain transformations on the data because data storage
      representations in the two systems are different.  For example,
      NVT-ASCII has different data storage representations in different
      systems.  DEC TOPS-20s's generally store NVT-ASCII as five 7-bit
      ASCII characters, left-justified in a 36-bit word. IBM Mainframe's
      store NVT-ASCII as 8-bit EBCDIC codes.  Multics stores NVT-ASCII
      as four 9-bit characters in a 36-bit word.  It is desirable to
      convert characters into the standard NVT-ASCII representation when
      transmitting text between dissimilar systems.  The sending and
      receiving sites would have to perform the necessary
      transformations between the standard representation and their
      internal representations.

</p>
<p>
      A different problem in representation arises when transmitting
      binary data (not character codes) between host systems with
      different word lengths.  It is not always clear how the sender
      should send data, and the receiver store it.  For example, when
      transmitting 32-bit bytes from a 32-bit word-length system to a
      36-bit word-length system, it may be desirable (for reasons of
      efficiency and usefulness) to store the 32-bit bytes
      right-justified in a 36-bit word in the latter system.  In any
      case, the user should have the option of specifying data
      representation and transformation functions.  It should be noted
      that FTP provides for very limited data type representations.
      Transformations desired beyond this limited capability should be
      performed by the user directly.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1.1"></a><h3>3.1.1.&nbsp;
Data Types</h3>

<p>
         Data representations are handled in FTP by a user specifying a
         representation type.  This type may implicitly (as in ASCII or
         EBCDIC) or explicitly (as in Local byte) define a byte size for
         interpretation which is referred to as the &quot;logical byte size.&quot;
         Note that this has nothing to do with the byte size used for
         transmission over the data connection, called the &quot;transfer
         byte size&quot;, and the two should not be confused.  For example,
         NVT-ASCII has a logical byte size of 8 bits.  If the type is
         Local byte, then the TYPE command has an obligatory second
         parameter specifying the logical byte size.  The transfer byte
         size is always 8 bits.

ASCII Type</h3>

<p>
            This is the default type and MUST be accepted by all FTP
            implementations.  It is intended primarily for the transfer
            of text files, except when both hosts would find the EBCDIC
            type more convenient.

</p>
<p>
            The sender converts the data from an internal character
            representation to the standard 8-bit NVT-ASCII
            representation (see <a class='info' href='#RFC0854'>[RFC0854]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J. and J. Reynolds, &ldquo;Telnet Protocol Specification,&rdquo; May&nbsp;1983.</span><span>)</span></a>).  The receiver
            will convert the data from the standard form to his own
            internal form.

</p>
<p>
            In accordance with the NVT standard, the &lt;CRLF&gt; sequence
            should be used where necessary to denote the end of a line
            of text.  (See the discussion of file structure at the end
            of the Section on Data Representation and Storage.)

</p>
<p>
            Using the standard NVT-ASCII representation means that data
            must be interpreted as 8-bit bytes.

EBCDIC Type</h3>

<p>
            This type is intended for efficient transfer between hosts
            which use EBCDIC for their internal character
            representation.

</p>
<p>
            For transmission, the data are represented as 8-bit EBCDIC
            characters.  The character code is the only difference
            between the functional specifications of EBCDIC and ASCII
            types.

</p>
<p>
            End-of-line (as opposed to end-of-record--see the discussion
            of structure) will probably be rarely used with EBCDIC type
            for purposes of denoting structure, but where it is
            necessary the &lt;NL&gt; character should be used.

Image Type</h3>

<p>
            The data are sent as contiguous bits which, for transfer,
            are packed into the 8-bit transfer bytes.  The receiving
            site must store the data as contiguous bits.  The structure
            of the storage system might necessitate the padding of the
            file (or of each record, for a record-structured file) to
            some convenient boundary (byte, word or block).  This
            padding, which must be all zeros, may occur only at the end
            of the file (or at the end of each record) and there must be
            a way of identifying the padding bits so that they may be
            stripped off if the file is retrieved.  The padding
            transformation should be well publicized to enable a user to
            process a file at the storage site.

</p>
<p>
            Image type is intended for the efficient storage and
            retrieval of files and for the transfer of binary data.  It
            is recommended that this type be accepted by all FTP
            implementations.

Local Type</h3>

<p>
            The data is transferred in logical bytes of the size
            specified by the obligatory second parameter, Byte size.
            The value of Byte size must be a decimal integer; there is
            no default value.  The logical byte size is not necessarily
            the same as the transfer byte size.  If there is a
            difference in byte sizes, then the logical bytes should be
            packed contiguously, disregarding transfer byte boundaries
            and with any necessary padding at the end.

</p>
<p>


</p>
<p>
            When the data reaches the receiving host, it will be
            transformed in a manner dependent on the logical byte size
            and the particular host.  This transformation must be
            invertible (i.e., an identical file can be retrieved if the
            same parameters are used) and should be well publicized by
            the FTP implementors.

</p>
<p>
            For example, a user sending 36-bit floating-point numbers to
            a host with a 32-bit word could send that data as Local byte
            with a logical byte size of 36.  The receiving host would
            then be expected to store the logical bytes so that they
            could be easily manipulated; in this example putting the
            36-bit logical bytes into 64-bit double words should
            suffice.

</p>
<p>
            In another example, a pair of hosts with a 36-bit word size
            may send data to one another in words by using TYPE L 36.
            The data would be sent in the 8-bit transmission bytes
            packed so that 9 transmission bytes carried two host words.

</p>
<p>
            An FTP program MUST support TYPE I ("IMAGE" or binary type)
            as well as TYPE L 8 ("LOCAL" type with logical byte size 8).
            A machine whose memory is organized into m-bit words, where
            m is not a multiple of 8, MAY also support TYPE L m.

            The types ASCII and EBCDIC also take a second (optional)
            parameter; this is to indicate what kind of vertical format
            control, if any, is associated with a file.  The following
            data representation types are defined in FTP:

</p>
<p>
            A character file may be transferred to a host for one of
            three purposes: for printing, for storage and later
            retrieval, or for processing.  If a file is sent for
            printing, the receiving host must know how the vertical
            format control is represented.  In the second case, it must
            be possible to store a file at a host and then retrieve it
            later in exactly the same form.  Finally, it should be
            possible to move a file from one host to another and process
            the file at the second host without undue trouble.  A single
            ASCII or EBCDIC format does not satisfy all these
            conditions.  Therefore, these types have a second parameter

               This is the default format to be used if the second
               (format) parameter is omitted.  Non-print format MUST be
               accepted by all FTP implementations.

</p>
<p>


</p>
<p>
               The file need contain no vertical format information.  If
               it is passed to a printer process, this process may
               assume standard values for spacing and margins.

</p>
<p>
               Normally, this format will be used with files destined
               for processing or just storage.

Carriage Control (ASA)</h3>

<p>
               The file contains ASA (FORTRAN) vertical format control
               characters.  (See RFC 740 Appendix C; and Communications
               of the ACM, Vol. 7, No. 10, p. 606, October 1964.)  In a
               line or a record formatted according to the ASA Standard,
               the first character is not to be printed.  Instead, it
               should be used to determine the vertical movement of the
               paper which should take place before the rest of the
               record is printed.

</p>
<p>
               The ASA Standard specifies the following control
               characters:
	 </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>

                  Character     Vertical Spacing

                  blank         Move paper up one line
                  0             Move paper up two lines
                  1             Move paper to top of next page
                  +             No movement, i.e., overprint
</pre></div><p>



</p>
<p>
               Clearly there must be some way for a printer process to
               distinguish the end of the structural entity.  If a file
               has record structure (see below) this is no problem;
               records will be explicitly marked during transfer and
               storage.  If the file has no record structure, the &lt;CRLF&gt;
               end-of-line sequence is used to separate printing lines,
               but these format effectors are overridden by the ASA
               controls.

Data Structures</h3>

<p>
         In addition to different representation types, FTP allows the
         structure of a file to be specified.  Three file structures are
         defined in FTP:

</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>

         file-structure,     where there is no internal structure and
                             the file is considered to be a
                             continuous sequence of data bytes,

         record-structure,   where the file is made up of sequential
                             records,

         and page-structure, where the file is made up of independent
                             indexed pages.
</pre></div><p>



</p>
<p>
         File-structure is the default to be assumed if the STRUcture
         command has not been used but both file and record structures
         must be accepted for &quot;text&quot; files (i.e., files with TYPE ASCII
         or EBCDIC) by all FTP implementations.  The structure of a file
         will affect both the transfer mode of a file (see <a class='info' href='#sec-3.4'>Section&nbsp;3.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Transmission Modes</span><span>)</span></a>) and the interpretation and storage of
         the file.

</p>
<p>
         The &quot;natural&quot; structure of a file will depend on which host
         stores the file.  A source-code file will usually be stored on
         an IBM Mainframe in fixed length records but on a DEC TOPS-20
         as a stream of characters partitioned into lines, for example
         by &lt;CRLF&gt;.  If the transfer of files between such disparate
         sites is to be useful, there must be some way for one site to
         recognize the other's assumptions about the file.

</p>
<p>
         With some sites being naturally file-oriented and others
         naturally record-oriented there may be problems if a file with
         one structure is sent to a host oriented to the other.  If a
         text file is sent with record-structure to a host which is file
         oriented, then that host should apply an internal
         transformation to the file based on the record structure.
            An FTP transformation between record-structure and file-structure SHOULD be invertible, to the extent possible while
            making the result useful on the target host.


</p>
<p>
         In the case of a file being sent with file-structure to a
         record-oriented host, there exists the question of what
         criteria the host should use to divide the file into records
         which can be processed locally.  If this division is necessary,
         the FTP implementation should use the end-of-line sequence,
         &lt;CRLF&gt; for ASCII, or &lt;NL&gt; for EBCDIC text files, as the
         delimiter.  If an FTP implementation adopts this technique, it
         must be prepared to reverse the transformation if the file is
         retrieved with file-structure.

Page Structure</h3>

<p>         Implementation of page structure is NOT RECOMMENDED in
            general. However, if a host system does need to implement
            FTP for "random access" or "holey" files, it MUST use the
            defined page structure format rather than define a new
            private FTP format.

</p>
<p>
            To transmit files that are discontinuous, FTP defines a page
            structure.  Files of this type are sometimes known as
            &quot;random access files&quot; or even as &quot;holey files&quot;.  In these
            files there is sometimes other information associated with
            the file as a whole (e.g., a file descriptor), or with a
            section of the file (e.g., page access controls), or both.
            In FTP, the sections of the file are called pages.

</p>
<p>
            To provide for various page sizes and associated
            information, each page is sent with a page header.  The page
            header has the following defined fields:

</p>
<p>
               Header Length

</p>
<p>
                  The number of logical bytes in the page header
                  including this byte.  The minimum header length is 4.

</p>
<p>
               Page Index

</p>
<p>
                  The logical page number of this section of the file.
                  This is not the transmission sequence number of this
                  page, but the index used to identify this page of the
                  file.

</p>
<p>
               Data Length

</p>
<p>
                  The number of logical bytes in the page data.  The
                  minimum data length is 0.

</p>
<p>
               Page Type

</p>
<p>
                  The type of page this is.  The following page types
                  are defined:

</p>
<p>
                     0 = Last Page

</p>
<p>
                        This is used to indicate the end of a paged
                        structured transmission.  The header length must
                        be 4, and the data length must be 0.

</p>
<p>
                     1 = Simple Page

</p>
<p>
                        This is the normal type for simple paged files
                        with no page level associated control
                        information.  The header length must be 4.

</p>
<p>
                     2 = Descriptor Page

</p>
<p>
                        This type is used to transmit the descriptive
                        information for the file as a whole.

</p>
<p>
                     3 = Access Controlled Page

</p>
<p>
                        This type includes an additional header field
                        for paged files with page level access control
                        information.  The header length must be 5.

</p>
<p>
               Optional Fields

</p>
<p>
                  Further header fields may be used to supply per page
                  control information, for example, per page access
                  control.

</p>
<p>
            All fields are one logical byte in length.  The logical byte
            size is specified by the TYPE command.  See <a class='info' href='#Appendix-A'>Appendix&nbsp;A<span> (</span><span class='info'>Page Structure</span><span>)</span></a> for
            further details and a specific case at the page structure.

</p>
<p>
      A note of caution about parameters:  a file must be stored and
      retrieved with the same parameters if the retrieved version is to
      be identical to the version originally transmitted.  Conversely,
      FTP implementations must return a file identical to the original
      if the parameters used to store and retrieve a file are the same.

Establishing Data Connections</h3>

<p>
      The mechanics of transferring data consists of setting up the data
      connection to the appropriate ports and choosing the parameters
      for transfer.  Both the user and the server-DTPs have a default
      data port.  The user-process default data port is the same as the
      control connection port (i.e., U).  The server-process default
      data port is the port adjacent to the control connection port
      (i.e., L-1).

</p>
<p>
      The transfer byte size is 8-bit bytes.  This byte size is relevant
      only for the actual transfer of the data; it has no bearing on
      representation of the data within a host's file system.

</p>
<p>
      The passive data transfer process (this may be a user-DTP or a
      second server-DTP) shall &quot;listen&quot; on the data port prior to
      sending a transfer request command.  The FTP request command
      determines the direction of the data transfer.  The server, upon
      receiving the transfer request, will initiate the data connection
      to the port.  When the connection is established, the data
      transfer begins between DTP's, and the server-PI sends a
      confirming reply to the user-PI.

</p>
<p>
      Every FTP implementation MUST support the use of the default data
      ports, and only the USER-PI can initiate a change to non-default
      ports.

</p>
<p>
      It is possible for the user to specify an alternate data port by
      use of the PORT command.  The user may want a file dumped on a TAC
      line printer or retrieved from a third party host.  In the latter
      case, the user-PI sets up control connections with both
      server-PI's.  One server is then told (by an FTP command) to
      &quot;listen&quot; for a connection which the other will initiate.  The
      user-PI sends one server-PI a PORT command indicating the data
      port of the other.  Finally, both are sent the appropriate
      transfer commands.  The exact sequence of commands and replies
      sent between the user-controller and the servers is defined in <a class='info' href='#sec-4.2'>Section&nbsp;4.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>FTP Replies</span><span>)</span></a>

</p>
<p>
      In general, it is the server's responsibility to maintain the data
      connection--to initiate it and to close it.  The exception to this
      is when the user-DTP is sending the data in a transfer mode that
      requires the connection to be closed to indicate EOF.  The server
      MUST close the data connection under the following conditions:
</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
         1. The server has completed sending data in a transfer mode
            that requires a close to indicate EOF.

</p>
<p>
         2. The server receives an ABORT command from the user.

</p>
<p>
         3. The port specification is changed by a command from the
            user.

</p>
<p>
         4. The control connection is closed legally or otherwise.

</p>
<p>
         5. An irrecoverable error condition occurs.

</p>
</blockquote><p>

</p>
<p>
      Otherwise the close is a server option, the exercise of which the
      server must indicate to the user-process by either a 250 or 226
      reply only.

<a name="rfc.section.3.3"></a><h3>3.3.&nbsp;
Data Connection Management</h3>

<p>
      Default Data Connection Ports:  All FTP implementations MUST
      support use of the default data connection ports, and only the
      User-PI may initiate the use of non-default ports.

</p>
<p>
      Negotiating Non-Default Data Ports:   The User-PI MAY specify a
      non-default user side data port with the PORT command.  The
      User-PI MAY request the server side to identify a non-default
      server side data port with the PASV command.  Since a connection
      is defined by the pair of addresses, either of these actions is
      enough to get a different data connection, still it is permitted
      to do both commands to use new ports on both ends of the data
      connection.
            A User-FTP that uses STREAM mode SHOULD send a PORT command
            to assign a non-default data port before each transfer
            command is issued.


</p>
<p>
      Reuse of the Data Connection:  When using the stream mode of data
      transfer the end of the file MUST be indicated by closing the
      connection.  This causes a problem if multiple files are to be
      transfered in the session, due to need for TCP to hold the
      connection record for a time out period to guarantee the reliable
      communication.  Thus the connection can not be reopened at once.

</p>
<p>
         There are two solutions to this problem.  The first is to
         negotiate a non-default port.  The second is to use another
         transfer mode.

</p>
<p>
         A comment on transfer modes.  The stream transfer mode is
         inherently unreliable, since one can not determine if the
         connection closed prematurely or not.  The other transfer modes
         (Block, Compressed) do not close the connection to indicate the
         end of file.  They have enough FTP encoding that the data
         connection can be parsed to determine the end of the file.
         Thus using these modes one can leave the data connection open
         for multiple file transfers.

<a name="rfc.section.3.4"></a><h3>3.4.&nbsp;
Transmission Modes</h3>

<p>
      The next consideration in transferring data is choosing the
      appropriate transmission mode.  There are three modes: one which
      formats the data and allows for restart procedures; one which also
      compresses the data for efficient transfer; and one which passes
      the data with little or no processing.  In this last case the mode
      interacts with the structure attribute to determine the type of
      processing.  In the compressed mode, the representation type
      determines the filler byte.

</p>
<p>
      All data transfers MUST be completed with an end-of-file (EOF)
      which MAY be explicitly stated or implied by the closing of the
      data connection.  For files with record structure, all the
      end-of-record markers (EOR) are explicit, including the final one.
      For files transmitted in page structure a &quot;last-page&quot; page type is
      used.

</p>
<p>
      NOTE:  In the rest of this section, byte means &quot;transfer byte&quot;
      except where explicitly stated otherwise.

</p>
<p>
      For the purpose of standardized transfer, the sending host will
      translate its internal end of line or end of record denotation
      into the representation prescribed by the transfer mode and file
      structure, and the receiving host will perform the inverse
      translation to its internal denotation.  An IBM Mainframe record
      count field may not be recognized at another host, so the
      end-of-record information may be transferred as a two byte control
      code in Stream mode or as a flagged bit in a Block or Compressed
      mode descriptor.  End-of-line in an ASCII or EBCDIC file with no
      record structure should be indicated by &lt;CRLF&gt; or &lt;NL&gt;,
      respectively.  Since these transformations imply extra work for
      some systems, identical systems transferring non-record structured
      text files might wish to use a binary representation and stream
      mode for the transfer.

</p>
<p>
      The following transmission modes are defined in FTP:

<a name="rfc.section.3.4.1"></a><h3>3.4.1.&nbsp;
Stream Mode</h3>

<p>
         The data is transmitted as a stream of bytes.  There is no
         restriction on the representation type used; record structures
         are allowed.

</p>
<p>
         In a record structured file EOR and EOF will each be indicated
         by a two-byte control code.  The first byte of the control code
         will be all ones, the escape character.  The second byte will
         have the low order bit on and zeros elsewhere for EOR and the
         second low order bit on for EOF; that is, the byte will have
         value 1 for EOR and value 2 for EOF.  EOR and EOF MAY be
         indicated together on the last byte transmitted by turning both
         low order bits on (i.e., the value 3).  If a byte of all ones
         was intended to be sent as data, it should be repeated in the
         second byte of the control code.

</p>
<p>
         If the structure is a file structure, the EOF is indicated by

Block Mode</h3>

<p>
         The file is transmitted as a series of data blocks preceded by
         one or more header bytes.  The header bytes contain a count
         field, and descriptor code.  The count field indicates the
         total length of the data block in bytes, thus marking the
         beginning of the next data block (there are no filler bits).
         The descriptor code defines:  last block in the file (EOF) last
         block in the record (EOR), restart marker (see <a class='info' href='#sec-3.5'>Section&nbsp;3.5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Error Recovery and Restart</span><span>)</span></a>) or suspect data (i.e., the data
         being transferred is suspected of errors and is not reliable).
         This last code is NOT intended for error control within FTP.
         It is motivated by the desire of sites exchanging certain types
         of data (e.g., seismic or weather data) to send and receive all
         the data despite local errors (such as &quot;magnetic tape read
         errors&quot;), but to indicate in the transmission that certain
         portions are suspect).  Record structures are allowed in this
         mode, and any representation type MAY be used.

</p>
<p>
         The header consists of the three bytes.  Of the 24 bits of
         header information, the 16 low order bits shall represent byte
         count, and the 8 high order bits shall represent descriptor
         codes as shown below.

         code number is the decimal value of the corresponding bit in
         the byte.

<p>
         With this encoding, more than one descriptor coded condition
         may exist for a particular block.  As many bits as necessary
         may be flagged.

</p>
<p>
         The restart marker is embedded in the data stream as an
         integral number of 8-bit bytes representing printable
         characters in the language being used over the control
         connection (e.g., default--NVT-ASCII).  &lt;SP&gt; (Space, in the
         appropriate language) MUST NOT be used WITHIN a restart marker.

Compressed Mode</h3>

<p>
         There are three kinds of information to be sent:  regular data,
         sent in a byte string; compressed data, consisting of
         replications or filler; and control information, sent in a
         two-byte escape sequence.  If n&gt;0 bytes (up to 127) of regular
         data are sent, these n bytes are preceded by a byte with the
         left-most bit set to 0 and the right-most 7 bits containing the
         number n.

</p>
<p>
         A string of n filler bytes can be compressed into a single
         byte, where the filler byte varies with the representation
         type.  If the type is ASCII or EBCDIC the filler byte is &lt;SP&gt;
         (Space, ASCII code 32, EBCDIC code 64).  If the type is Image
         or Local byte the filler is a zero byte.

         The escape sequence is a double byte, the first of which is the
         escape byte (all zeros) and the second of which contains
         descriptor codes as defined in Block mode.  The descriptor
         codes have the same meaning as in Block mode and apply to the
         succeeding string of bytes.

</p>
<p>
         Compressed mode is useful for obtaining increased bandwidth on
         very large network transmissions at a little extra CPU cost.
         It can be most effectively used to reduce the size of printer
         files such as those generated by RJE hosts.

Error Recovery and Restart</h3>

<p>
      There is no provision for detecting bits lost or scrambled in data
      transfer; this level of error control is handled by the TCP.
      However, a restart procedure is provided to protect users from
      gross system failures (including failures of a host, an
      FTP-process, or the underlying network).

</p>
<p>
      The restart procedure is defined only for the block and compressed
      modes of data transfer.  It requires the sender of data to insert
      a special marker code in the data stream with some marker
      information.  The marker information has meaning only to the
      sender, but MUST consist of printable characters in the default or
      negotiated language of the control connection (ASCII or EBCDIC).
      The marker could represent a bit-count, a record-count, or any
      other information by which a system may identify a data
      checkpoint.  The receiver of data, if it implements the restart
      procedure, would then mark the corresponding position of this
      marker in the receiving system, and return this information to the
      user.

</p>
<p>
      In the event of a system failure, the user can restart the data
      transfer by identifying the marker point with the FTP restart
      procedure.  The following example illustrates the use of the
      restart procedure.

</p>
<p>
      The sender of the data inserts an appropriate marker block in the
      data stream at a convenient point.  The receiving host marks the
      corresponding data point in its file system and conveys the last
      known sender and receiver marker information to the user, either
      directly or over the control connection in a 110 reply (depending
      on who is the sender).  In the event of a system failure, the user
      or controller process restarts the server at the last server
      marker by sending a restart command with server's marker code as
      its argument.  The restart command is transmitted over the control
      connection and is immediately followed by the command (such as
      RETR, STOR or LIST) which was being executed when the system
      failure occurred.

File Transfer Functions</h3>

<p>
   The communication channel from the user-PI to the server-PI is
   established as a TCP connection from the user to the standard server
   port.  The user protocol interpreter is responsible for sending FTP
   commands and interpreting the replies received; the server-PI
   interprets commands, sends replies and directs its DTP to set up the
   data connection and transfer the data.  If the second party to the
   data transfer (the passive transfer process) is the user-DTP, then it
   is governed through the internal protocol of the user-FTP host; if it
   is a second server-DTP, then it is governed by its PI on command from
   the user-PI.  The FTP replies are discussed in the next section.  In
   the description of a few of the commands in this section, it is
   helpful to be explicit about the possible replies.

Access Control Commands</h3>

<p>
         The following commands specify access control identifiers
         (command codes are shown in parentheses).

</p>
<p>
USER NAME (USER)
</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
            The argument field is a Telnet string identifying the user.
            The user identification is that which is required by the
            server for access to its file system.  This command will
            normally be the first command transmitted by the user after
            the control connections are made (some servers MAY require
            this).  Additional identification information in the form of
            a password and/or an account command MAY also be required by
            some servers.  Servers MAY allow a new USER command to be
            entered at any point in order to change the access control
            and/or accounting information.  This has the effect of
            flushing any user, password, and account information already
            supplied and beginning the login sequence again.  All
            transfer parameters are unchanged and any file transfer in
            progress is completed under the old access control
            parameters.

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
PASSWORD (PASS)
</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
            The argument field is a Telnet string specifying the user's
            password.  This command MUST be immediately preceded by the
            user name command, and, for some sites, completes the user's
            identification for access control.  Since password
            information is quite sensitive, it is desirable in general
            to &quot;mask&quot; it or suppress typeout.  It appears that the
            server has no foolproof way to achieve this.  It is
            therefore the responsibility of the user-FTP process to hide
            the sensitive password information.

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
         ACCOUNT (ACCT)
</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
            The argument field is a Telnet string identifying the user's
            account.  The command is not necessarily related to the USER
            command, as some sites may require an account for login and
            others only for specific access, such as storing files.  In
            the latter case the command may arrive at any time.

</p>
<p>
            There are reply codes to differentiate these cases for the
            automation: when account information is required for login,
            the response to a successful PASSword command is reply code
            332.  On the other hand, if account information is NOT
            required for login, the reply to a successful PASSword
            command is 230; and if the account information is needed for
            a command issued later in the dialogue, the server should
            return a 332 or 532 reply depending on whether it stores
            (pending receipt of the ACCounT command) or discards the
            command, respectively.

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
         CHANGE WORKING DIRECTORY (CWD)
</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
            This command allows the user to work with a different
            directory or dataset for file storage or retrieval without
            altering his login or accounting information.  Transfer
            parameters are similarly unchanged.  The argument is a
            pathname specifying a directory or other system dependent
            file group designator.

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
         CHANGE TO PARENT DIRECTORY (CDUP)
</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
            This command is a special case of CWD, and is included to
            simplify the implementation of programs for transferring
            directory trees between operating systems having different
            syntaxes for naming the parent directory.  The reply codes
            shall be identical to the reply codes of CWD.  See
            <a class='info' href='#Appendix-B'>Appendix&nbsp;B<span> (</span><span class='info'>Directory Commands</span><span>)</span></a> for further details.

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
         STRUCTURE MOUNT (SMNT)
</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
            This command allows the user to mount a different file
            system data structure without altering his login or
            accounting information.  Transfer parameters are similarly
            unchanged.  The argument is a pathname specifying a
            directory or other system dependent file group designator.

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
         REINITIALIZE (REIN)
</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
            This command terminates a USER, flushing all I/O and account
            information, except to allow any transfer in progress to be
            completed.  All parameters are reset to the default settings
            and the control connection is left open.  This is identical
            to the state in which a user finds himself immediately after
            the control connection is opened.  A USER command may be
            expected to follow.

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
         LOGOUT (QUIT)
</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
            This command terminates a USER and if file transfer is not
            in progress, the server closes the control connection.  If
            file transfer is in progress, the connection will remain
            open for result response and the server will then close it.
            If the user-process is transferring files for several USERs
            but does not wish to close and then reopen connections for
            each, then the REIN command should be used instead of QUIT.

</p>
<p>
            An unexpected close on the control connection will cause the
            server to take the effective action of an abort (ABOR) and a
            logout (QUIT).

Transfer Parameter Commands</h3>

<p>
         All data transfer parameters have default values, and the
         commands specifying data transfer parameters are required only
         if the default parameter values are to be changed.  The default
         value is the last specified value, or if no value has been
         specified, the standard default value is as stated here.  This
         implies that the server must &quot;remember&quot; the applicable default
         values.  The commands MAY be in any order except that they MUST
         precede the FTP service request.  The following commands
         specify data transfer parameters:

</p>
<p>
DATA PORT (PORT)
</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
            The argument is a HOST-PORT specification for the data port
            to be used in data connection.  There are defaults for both
            the user and server data ports, and under normal
            circumstances this command and its reply are not needed.  If
            this command is used, the argument is the concatenation of a
            32-bit internet host address and a 16-bit TCP port address.
            This address information is broken into 8-bit fields and the
            value of each field is transmitted as a decimal number (in
            character string representation).  The fields are separated
            by commas.  A port command would be:


</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>PORT h1,h2,h3,h4,p1,p2
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
            where h1 is the high order 8 bits of the internet host
            address.

</p>
</blockquote><p>

</p>
<p>
         PASSIVE (PASV)
</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
            This command requests the server-DTP to &quot;listen&quot; on a data
            port (which is not its default data port) and to wait for a
            connection rather than initiate one upon receipt of a
            transfer command.  The response to this command includes the
            host and port address this server is listening on.
</p>
<p>
            A server-FTP MUST implement the PASV command.

</p>
<p>
            If multiple third-party transfers are to be executed during
            the same session, a new PASV command MUST be issued before

Extensions for IPv6 and NATs: Extended Port (EPRT) and Extended Passive Mode (EPSV)</h3>

<p>
   Originally, the File Transfer Protocol <a class='info' href='#RFC0959'>[RFC0959]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J. and J. Reynolds, &ldquo;File Transfer Protocol,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1985.</span><span>)</span></a> only provided the ability to

   network addresses will be 32 bits in length.  However, with the
   deployment of version 6 of the Internet Protocol <a class='info' href='#RFC2460'>[RFC2460]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Deering, S. and R. Hinden, &ldquo;Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification,&rdquo; December&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> addresses
   will no longer be 32 bits long.  <a class='info' href='#RFC1639'>[RFC1639]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Piscitello, D., &ldquo;FTP Operation Over Big Address Records (FOOBAR),&rdquo; June&nbsp;1994.</span><span>)</span></a> (now obsolete) specifies
   extensions to FTP to enable its use over various network protocols.
   Unfortunately, the mechanism can fail in a multi-protocol
   environment.  During the transition between IPv4 and IPv6, FTP needs
   the ability to negotiate the network protocol that will be used for
   data transfer.

</p>
<p>
   This section provides a specification for a way that FTP can
   communicate data connection endpoint information for network
   protocols other than IPv4.  In this section, the FTP commands
   PORT and PASV are replaced with EPRT and EPSV, respectively.

The EPRT Command</h3>

<p>
   The EPRT command allows for the specification of an extended address
   for the data connection.  The extended address MUST consist of the
   network protocol as well as the network and transport addresses.  The
   format of EPRT is:

</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
           EPRT&lt;space&gt;&lt;d&gt;&lt;net-prt&gt;&lt;d&gt;&lt;net-addr&gt;&lt;d&gt;&lt;tcp-port&gt;&lt;d&gt;
</pre></div><p>


</p>
<p>
   The EPRT command keyword MUST be followed by a single space (ASCII
   32).  Following the space, a delimiter character (&lt;d&gt;) MUST be
   specified.  The delimiter character MUST be one of the ASCII
   characters in range 33-126 inclusive.  The character &quot;|&quot; (ASCII 124)
   is recommended unless it coincides with a character needed to encode
   the network address.

</p>
<p>
   The &lt;net-prt&gt; argument MUST be an address family number defined by
   the IANA "Port Numbers" Registry at http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers.  This number indicates the protocol to be
   used (and, implicitly, the address length).  This document will use
   two of address family numbers from the IANA "Address Family Numbers" Registry at http://www.iana.org/assignments/address-family-numbers/address-family-numbers.xhtml as examples, according to
   the following table:

</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
        AF Number   Protocol
        ---------   --------
        1           Internet Protocol, Version 4 [RFC0791]
        2           Internet Protocol, Version 6 [RFC2460]
</pre></div><p>



</p>
<p>
   The &lt;net-addr&gt; is a protocol specific string representation of the
   network address.  For the two address families specified above (AF
   Number 1 and 2), addresses MUST be in the following format:

</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
        AF Number   Address Format      Example
        ---------   --------------      -------
        1           dotted decimal      132.235.1.2
        2           IPv6 string         1080::8:800:200C:417A
                    representations
                    defined in [RFC2460]
</pre></div><p>



</p>
<p>
   The &lt;tcp-port&gt; argument must be the string representation of the
   number of the TCP port on which the host is listening for the data
   connection.

</p>
<p>
   The following are sample EPRT commands:
	 </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>

        EPRT |1|132.235.1.2|6275|

        EPRT |2|1080::8:800:200C:417A|5282|
</pre></div><p>


</p>
<p>
   The first command specifies that the server should use IPv4 to open a
   data connection to the host &quot;132.235.1.2&quot; on TCP port 6275.  The
   second command specifies that the server should use the IPv6 network
   protocol and the network address &quot;1080::8:800:200C:417A&quot; to open a
   TCP data connection on port 5282.

</p>
<p>
   Upon receipt of a valid EPRT command, the server MUST return a code
   of 200 (Command OK).  The standard negative error code 500 and 501
   <a class='info' href='#RFC0959'>[RFC0959]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J. and J. Reynolds, &ldquo;File Transfer Protocol,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1985.</span><span>)</span></a> are sufficient to handle most errors (e.g., syntax errors)
   involving the EPRT command.  However, an additional error code is
   needed.  The response code 522 indicates that the server does not
   support the requested network protocol.  The interpretation of this
   new error code is:
	 </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
        5yz Negative Completion
        x2z Connections
        xy2 Extended Port Failure - unknown network protocol
</pre></div><p>



</p>
<p>
   The text portion of the response MUST indicate which network
   protocols the server does support.  If the network protocol is
   unsupported, the format of the response string MUST be:

</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
        &lt;text stating that the network protocol is unsupported&gt; \
            (prot1,prot2,...,protn)
</pre></div><p>



</p>
<p>
   Both the numeric code specified above and the protocol information
   between the characters '(' and ')' are intended for the software
   automata receiving the response; the textual message between the
   numeric code and the '(' is intended for the human user and can be
   any arbitrary text, but MUST NOT include the characters '(' and ')'.
   In the above case, the text SHOULD indicate that the network protocol
   in the EPRT command is not supported by the server.  The list of
   protocols inside the parenthesis MUST be a comma separated list of
   address family numbers.  Two example response strings follow:

</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
        Network protocol not supported, use (1)

<a name="rfc.section.4.1.2.1.2"></a><h3>4.1.2.1.2.&nbsp;
The EPSV Command</h3>

<p>
   The EPSV command requests that a server listen on a data port and
   wait for a connection.  The EPSV command takes an optional argument.
   The response to this command includes only the TCP port number of the
   listening connection.  The format of the response, however, is
   similar to the argument of the EPRT command.  This allows the same
   parsing routines to be used for both commands.  In addition, the
   format leaves a place holder for the network protocol and/or network
   address, which may be needed in the EPSV response in the future.  The
   response code for entering passive mode using an extended address
   MUST be 229.  The interpretation of this code, according to <a class='info' href='#RFC0959'>[RFC0959]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J. and J. Reynolds, &ldquo;File Transfer Protocol,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1985.</span><span>)</span></a>
   is:

</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
        2yz Positive Completion
        x2z Connections
        xy9 Extended Passive Mode Entered

   The text returned in response to the EPSV command MUST be:

        &lt;text indicating server is entering extended passive mode&gt; \
            (&lt;d&gt;&lt;d&gt;&lt;d&gt;&lt;tcp-port&gt;&lt;d&gt;)
</pre></div><p>


</p>
<p>
   The portion of the string enclosed in parentheses MUST be the exact
   string needed by the EPRT command to open the data connection, as
   specified above.

</p>
<p>
   The first two fields contained in the parenthesis MUST be blank.  The
   third field MUST be the string representation of the TCP port number
   on which the server is listening for a data connection.  The network
   protocol used by the data connection will be the same network
   protocol used by the control connection.  In addition, the network
   address used to establish the data connection will be the same
   network address used for the control connection.  An example response
   string follows:

</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
        Entering Extended Passive Mode (|||6446|)
</pre></div><p>



</p>
<p>
   The standard negative error codes 500 and 501 are sufficient to
   handle all errors involving the EPSV command (e.g., syntax errors).

</p>
<p>
   When the EPSV command is issued with no argument, the server will
   choose the network protocol for the data connection based on the
   protocol used for the control connection.  However, in the case of
   proxy FTP, this protocol might not be appropriate for communication
   between the two servers.  Therefore, the client needs to be able to
   request a specific protocol.  If the server returns a protocol that
   is not supported by the host that will be connecting to the port, the
   client MUST issue an ABOR (abort) command to allow the server to
   close down the listening connection.  The client can then send an
   EPSV command requesting the use of a specific network protocol, as
   follows:

</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
        EPSV&lt;space&gt;&lt;net-prt&gt;
</pre></div><p>



</p>
<p>
   If the requested protocol is supported by the server, it SHOULD use
   the protocol.  If not, the server MUST return the 522 error messages
   as outlined in <a class='info' href='#sec-4.1.2.1.1'>Section&nbsp;4.1.2.1.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>The EPRT Command</span><span>)</span></a>.

</p>
<p>
   Finally, the EPSV command can be used with the argument &quot;ALL&quot; to
   inform Network Address Translators that the EPRT command (as well as
   other data commands) will no longer be used.  An example of this
   command follows:

</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
        EPSV&lt;space&gt;ALL
</pre></div><p>



</p>
<p>
   Upon receipt of an EPSV ALL command, the server MUST reject all data
   connection setup commands other than EPSV (i.e., EPRT, PORT, PASV, et
   al.).  This use of the EPSV command is further explained in <a class='info' href='#sec-4.1.2.1.3'>Section&nbsp;4.1.2.1.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Command Usage</span><span>)</span></a>.

<a name="rfc.section.4.1.2.1.3"></a><h3>4.1.2.1.3.&nbsp;
Command Usage</h3>

<p>
   For all FTP transfers where the control and data connection(s) are
   being established between the same two machines, the EPSV command
   MUST be used.  Using the EPSV command benefits performance of
   transfers that traverse firewalls or Network Address Translators
   (NATs).  RFC 1579 recommends using the passive command when
   behind firewalls since firewalls do not generally allow incoming
   connections (which are required when using the PORT (EPRT) command).
   In addition, using EPSV as defined in this document does not require
   NATs to change the network address in the traffic as it is forwarded.
   The NAT would have to change the address if the EPRT command was
   used.  Finally, if the client issues an &quot;EPSV ALL&quot; command, NATs may
   be able to put the connection on a &quot;fast path&quot; through the
   translator, as the EPRT command will never be used and therefore,
   translation of the data portion of the segments will never be needed.
   When a client only expects to do two-way FTP transfers, it SHOULD
   issue this command as soon as possible.  If a client later finds that
   it must do a three-way FTP transfer after issuing an EPSV ALL
   command, a new FTP session MUST be started.

FTP Service Commands</h3>

<p>
         The FTP service commands define the file transfer or the file
         system function requested by the user.  The argument of an FTP
         service command will normally be a pathname.  The syntax of
         pathnames must conform to server site conventions (with
         standard defaults applicable), and the language conventions of
         the control connection.  The suggested default handling is to
         use the last specified device, directory or file name, or the
         standard default defined for local users.  The commands MAY be
         in any order except that a &quot;rename from&quot; command MUST be
         followed by a &quot;rename to&quot; command and the restart command MUST
         be followed by the interrupted service command (e.g., STOR or
         RETR).  The data, when transferred in response to FTP service
         commands, shall always be sent over the data connection, except
         for certain informative replies.  The following commands
         specify FTP service requests:

</p>

               (if it is open) and responds with a 226 reply, indicating
               that the abort command was successfully processed.

</p>
<p>
               In the second case, the server aborts the FTP service in
               progress and closes the data connection, returning a 426
               reply to indicate that the service request terminated
               abnormally.  The server then sends a 226 reply,
               indicating that the abort command was successfully
               processed.

<p>
   The File Transfer Protocol follows the specifications of the Telnet
   protocol for all communications over the control connection.  Since
   the language used for Telnet communication may be a negotiated
   option, all references in the next two sections will be to the
   &quot;Telnet language&quot; and the corresponding &quot;Telnet end-of-line code&quot;.
   Currently, one may take these to mean NVT-ASCII and &lt;CRLF&gt;.  No other
   specifications of the Telnet protocol will be cited.

</p>
<p>
   FTP commands are &quot;Telnet strings&quot; terminated by the &quot;Telnet end of
   line code&quot;.  The command codes themselves are alphabetic characters
   terminated by the character &lt;SP&gt; (Space) if parameters follow and
   Telnet-EOL otherwise.  
            Implementors MUST NOT assume any correspondence between READ
            boundaries on the control connection and the Telnet EOL
            sequences (CR LF).
   The command codes and the semantics of
   commands are described in this section; the detailed syntax of
   commands is specified in <a class='info' href='#sec-5.3'>Section&nbsp;5.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Commands</span><span>)</span></a>, the reply sequences

Special Action

</p>
<p>
   FTP commands may be partitioned as those specifying access-control
   identifiers, data transfer parameters, or FTP service requests.
   Certain commands (such as ABOR, STAT, QUIT) MAY be sent over the
   control connection while a data transfer is in progress.  Some
   servers may not be able to monitor the control and data connections
   simultaneously, in which case some special action will be necessary
   to get the server's attention.  The following ordered format is
   tentatively recommended:
</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
      1. User system inserts the Telnet "Interrupt Process" (IP) signal
      in the Telnet stream.

</p>
<p>
      2. User system sends the Telnet "Synch" signal.

</p>
<p>
      3. User system inserts the command (e.g., ABOR) in the Telnet
      stream.

</p>
<p>
      4. Server PI, after receiving "IP", scans the Telnet stream for
      EXACTLY ONE FTP command.

Feature Negotiation Mechanism</h3>

<p>
   The &quot;FEAT&quot; and &quot;OPTS&quot; commands allow a client to discover which optional commands a
   server supports, and how they are supported, and to select among
   various options that any FTP command may support.

</p>
<p>
   It is not to be expected that all servers will necessarily support
   all of the new commands defined in all future amendments to the FTP
   protocol.  In order to permit clients to determine which new commands
   are supported by a particular server, without trying each possible
   command, one new command is added to the FTP command repertoire.
   This command requests the server to list all extension commands, or
   extended mechanisms, that it supports.  That is, all defined and
   specified commands and features not defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC0959'>[RFC0959]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J. and J. Reynolds, &ldquo;File Transfer Protocol,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1985.</span><span>)</span></a>, or this document,
   must be included in the FEAT command output in the form specified in
   the document that defines the extension.

</p>
<p>
   User-FTP PIs must expect to see, in FEAT command responses, unknown
   features listed.  This is not an error, and simply indicates that the
   server-FTP implementor has seen, and implemented, the specification
   of a new feature that is unknown to the user-FTP.

<a name="rfc.section.4.1.4.2"></a><h3>4.1.4.2.&nbsp;
FEAT Command Responses</h3>

<p>
   Where a server-FTP process does not support the FEAT command, it will
   respond to the FEAT command with a 500 or 502 reply.  This is simply
   the normal &quot;unrecognized command&quot; reply that any unknown command
   would elicit.  Errors in the command syntax, such as giving
   parameters, will result in a 501 reply.

</p>
<p>
   Server-FTP processes that recognize the FEAT command, but implement
   no extended features, and therefore have nothing to report, SHOULD
   respond with the &quot;no-features&quot; 211 reply.  However, as this case is
   practically indistinguishable from a server-FTP that does not
   recognize the FEAT command, a 500 or 502 reply MAY also be used.  The
   &quot;no-features&quot; reply MUST NOT use the multi-line response format,
   exactly one response line is required and permitted.

</p>
<p>
   Replies to the FEAT command MUST comply with the following syntax.
   Text on the first line of the reply is free form, and not
   interpreted, and has no practical use, as this text is not expected
   to be revealed to end users.  The syntax of other reply lines is
   precisely defined, and if present, MUST be exactly as specified.

</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
     feat-response   = error-response / no-features / feature-listing
     no-features     = "211" SP *TCHAR CRLF
     feature-listing = "211-" *TCHAR CRLF
                       1*( SP feature CRLF )
                       "211 End" CRLF

     feature-label   = 1*VCHAR
     feature-parms   = 1*TCHAR
</pre></div><p>



</p>
<p>
   Note that each feature line in the feature-listing begins with a
   single space.  That space is not optional, nor does it indicate
   general white space.  This space guarantees that the feature line can

</p>
<p>
   never be misinterpreted as the end of the feature-listing, but is
   required even where there is no possibility of ambiguity.

</p>
<p>
   Each extension supported must be listed on a separate line to
   facilitate the possible inclusion of parameters supported by each
   extension command.  The feature-label to be used in the response to
   the FEAT command will be specified as each new feature is added to
   the FTP command set.  Often it will be the name of a new command
   added, however this is not required.  In fact it is not required that
   a new feature actually add a new command.  Any parameters included
   are to be specified with the definition of the command concerned.
   That specification shall also specify how any parameters present are
   to be interpreted.

</p>
<p>
   The feature-label and feature-parms are nominally case sensitive,
   however the definitions of specific labels and parameters specify the
   precise interpretation, and it is to be expected that those
   definitions will usually specify the label and parameters in a case
   independent manner.  Where this is done, implementations are
   recommended to use upper case letters when transmitting the feature
   response.

</p>
<p>
   The FEAT command itself is not included in the list of features
   supported, support for the FEAT command is indicated by return of a
   reply other than a 500 or 502 reply.

</p>
<p>
   A typical example reply to the FEAT command might be a multiline
   reply of the form:

</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
        C&gt; feat
        S&gt; 211-Extensions supported:
        S&gt;  MLST size*;create;modify*;perm;media-type
        S&gt;  SIZE
        S&gt;  COMPRESSION
        S&gt;  MDTM
        S&gt; 211 END
</pre></div><p>



</p>
<p>
   The particular extensions shown here are simply examples of what may
   be defined in other places, no particular meaning should be
   attributed to them.  Recall also, that the feature names returned are
   not command names, as such, but simply indications that the server
   possesses some attribute or other.

</p>
<p>
   The order in which the features are returned is of no importance,
   server-FTP processes are not required to implement any particular
   order, or even to consistently return the same order when the command
   is repeated.

</p>
<p>
   FTP implementations which support FEAT MUST include in the response
   to the FEAT command all properly documented FTP extensions beyond
   those commands and mechanisms described in RFC959, including any
   which existed before the existence of FEAT.  That is, when a client
   receives a FEAT response from an FTP server, it can assume that the
   only extensions the server supports are those that are listed in the
   FEAT response.

</p>
<p>
   User-FTP processes should, however, be aware that there have been
   several FTP extensions developed, and in widespread use, prior to the
   adoption of this document and the FEAT command.  The effect of this
   is that an error response to the FEAT command does not necessarily
   imply that those extensions are not supported by the server-FTP
   process.  User-PIs should test for such extensions individually if an
   error response has been received to the FEAT command.

Rationale for FEAT</h3>

<p>
   While not absolutely necessary, a standard mechanism for the server-PI to inform the user-PI of any features and extensions supported
   will help reduce unnecessary traffic between the user-PI and server-PI as more extensions may be introduced in the future.  If no
   mechanism existed for this, a user-FTP process would have to try each
   extension in turn resulting in a series of exchanges between the
   user-PI and server-PI.  Apart from being possibly wasteful, this
   procedure may not always be possible, as issuing of a command just to
   determine if it is supported or not may have some effect that is not
   desired.

<a name="rfc.section.4.1.4.4"></a><h3>4.1.4.4.&nbsp;
The OPTS Command</h3>

<p>
   The OPTS (options) command allows a user-PI to specify the desired
   behavior of a server-FTP process when another FTP command (the target
   command) is later issued.  The exact behavior, and syntax, will vary
   with the target command indicated, and will be specified with the
   definition of that command.  Where no OPTS behavior is defined for a
   particular command there are no options available for that command.

     opts-cmd         = "opts"

     response-message = *TCHAR

</pre></div><p>


</p>
<p>
   An &quot;opts-good&quot; response (200 reply) MUST be sent when the command-name specified in the OPTS command is recognized, and the command-
   options, if any, are recognized, and appropriate.  An &quot;opts-bad&quot;
   response is sent in other cases.  A 501 reply is appropriate for any
   permanent error.  That is, for any case where simply repeating the
   command at some later time, without other changes of state, will also
   be an error.  A 451 reply should be sent where some temporary
   condition at the server, not related to the state of communications
   between user and server, prevents the command being accepted when
   issued, but where if repeated at some later time, a changed
   environment for the server-FTP process may permit the command to
   succeed.  If the OPTS command itself is not recognized, a 500 or 502
   reply will, of course, result.

</p>
<p>
   The OPTS command MUST be implemented whenever the FEAT command is
   implemented.  Because of that, there is no indication in the list of
   features returned by FEAT to indicate that the OPTS command itself is
   supported.  Neither the FEAT command, nor the OPTS command, have any
   optional functionality, thus there are no &quot;OPTS FEAT&quot; or &quot;OPTS OPTS&quot;
   commands.

File Modification Time (MDTM)</h3>

<p>
   The FTP command, MODIFICATION TIME (MDTM), can be used to determine
   when a file in the server NVFS was last modified.  This command has
   existed in many FTP servers for many years, as an adjunct to the REST
   command for STREAM mode, thus is widely available.  However, where
   supported, the &quot;modify&quot; fact that can be provided in the result from
   the new MLST command is recommended as a superior alternative.

</p>
<p>
   When attempting to restart a RETRieve, the user-FTP can use the MDTM
   command or the &quot;modify&quot; fact to check if the modification time of the
   source file is more recent than the modification time of the
   partially transferred file.  If it is, then most likely the source
   file has changed, and it would be unsafe to restart the previously
   incomplete file transfer.

</p>
<p>
   Because the user- and server-FTPs' clocks are not necessarily
   synchronised, user-FTPs intending to use this method should usually
   obtain the modification time of the file from the server before the
   initial RETRieval, and compare that with the modification time before
   a RESTart.  If they differ, the files may have changed, and RESTart
   would be inadvisable.  Where this is not possible, the user-FTP
   should make sure to allow for possible clock skew when comparing
   times.

</p>
<p>
   When attempting to restart a STORe, the User FTP can use the MDTM
   command to discover the modification time of the partially
   transferred file.  If it is older than the modification time of the
   file that is about to be STORed, then most likely the source file has
   changed, and it would be unsafe to restart the file transfer.

</p>
<p>
   Note that using MLST (described below), where available, can provide
   this information and much more, thus giving an even better indication
   that a file has changed and that restarting a transfer would not give
   valid results.

</p>
<p>
   Note that this is applicable to any RESTart attempt, regardless of
   the mode of the file transfer.

<p>
   The syntax for the MDTM command is:

</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
      mdtm          = "MdTm" SP pathname CRLF
</pre></div><p>


</p>
<p>
   As with all FTP commands, the &quot;MDTM&quot; command label is interpreted in
   a case-insensitive manner.

</p>
<p>
   The &quot;pathname&quot; specifies an object in the NVFS that may be the object
   of a RETR command.  Attempts to query the modification time of files
   that exist but are unable to be retrieved may generate an error-
   response, or can result in a positive response carrying a time-val
   with an unspecified value, the choice being made by the server-PI.

</p>
<p>
   The server-PI will respond to the MDTM command with a 213 reply
   giving the last modification time of the file whose pathname was
   supplied, or a 550 reply if the file does not exist, the modification
   time is unavailable, or some other error has occurred.

</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>

                      error-response
</pre></div><p>


</p>
<p>
   Note that when the 213 response is issued, that is, when there is no
   error, the format MUST be exactly as specified.  Multi-line responses
   are not permitted.

File SIZE</h3>

<p>
   The FTP command, SIZE OF FILE (SIZE), is used to obtain the transfer
   size of a file from the server-FTP process.  This is the exact number
   of octets (8 bit bytes) that would be transmitted over the data
   connection should that file be transmitted.  This value will change
   depending on the current STRUcture, MODE, and TYPE of the data
   connection or of a data connection that would be created were one
   created now.  Thus, the result of the SIZE command is dependent on
   the currently established STRU, MODE, and TYPE parameters.

</p>
<p>
   The SIZE command returns how many octets would be transferred if the
   file were to be transferred using the current transfer structure,
   mode, and type.  This command is normally used in conjunction with
   the RESTART (REST) command when STORing a file to a remote server in
   STREAM mode, to determine the restart point.  The server-PI might
   need to read the partially transferred file, do any appropriate
   conversion, and count the number of octets that would be generated
   when sending the file in order to correctly respond to this command.
   Estimates of the file transfer size MUST NOT be returned; only
   precise information is acceptable.

   Consider a text file &quot;Example&quot; stored on a Unix(TM) server where each
   end of line is represented by a single octet.  Assume the file
   contains 112 lines, and 1830 octets total.  Then the SIZE command
   would produce:

</p>
<p>
   Notice that with TYPE=A the SIZE command reports an extra 112 octets.
   Those are the extra octets that need to be inserted, one at the end
   of each line, to provide correct end-of-line semantics for a transfer
   using TYPE=A.  Other systems might need to make other changes to the
   transfer format of files when converting between TYPEs and MODEs.
   The SIZE command takes all of that into account.

</p>
<p>
   Since calculating the size of a file with this degree of precision
   may take considerable effort on the part of the server-PI, user-PIs
   should not used this command unless this precision is essential (such
   as when about to restart an interrupted transfer).  For other uses,

Restart of Interrupted Transfer (REST)</h3>

<p>
   To avoid having to resend the entire file if the file is only
   partially transferred, both sides need some way to agree on where in
   the data stream to restart the data transfer.

</p>
<p>
   The FTP specification <a class='info' href='#RFC0959'>[RFC0959]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J. and J. Reynolds, &ldquo;File Transfer Protocol,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1985.</span><span>)</span></a> includes three modes of data transfer,
   STREAM, Block, and Compressed.  In Block and Compressed modes, the
   data stream that is transferred over the data connection is
   formatted, allowing the embedding of restart markers into the stream.
   The sending DTP can include a restart marker with whatever
   information it needs to be able to restart a file transfer at that
   point.  The receiving DTP can keep a list of these restart markers,
   and correlate them with how the file is being saved.  To restart the
   file transfer, the receiver just sends back that last restart marker,
   and both sides know how to resume the data transfer.  

</p>
<p>A restart
            reply message, sent over the control connection from the
            receiving FTP to the User-FTP, has the format:
</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
                110 MARK ssss = rrrr

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
            Here:
</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
            *    ssss is a text string that appeared in a Restart Marker
                 in the data stream and encodes a position in the
                 sender's file system;

</p>
<p>
            *    rrrr encodes the corresponding position in the
                 receiver's file system.

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
            The encoding, which is specific to a particular file system
            and network implementation, is always generated and
            interpreted by the same system, either sender or receiver.

</p>
<p>
            When an FTP that implements restart receives a Restart
            Marker in the data stream, it SHOULD force the data to that
            point to be written to stable storage before encoding the
            corresponding position rrrr.  An FTP sending Restart Markers
            MUST NOT assume that 110 replies will be returned
            synchronously with the data, i.e., it must not await a 110
            reply before sending more data.

<a name="rfc.section.4.1.5.3.1"></a><h3>4.1.5.3.1.&nbsp;
Restarting in STREAM Mode</h3>

<p>
   In STREAM mode, the data connection contains just a stream of
   unformatted octets of data.  Explicit restart markers thus cannot be
   inserted into the data stream, they would be indistinguishable from
   data.  For this reason, the FTP specification <a class='info' href='#RFC0959'>[RFC0959]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J. and J. Reynolds, &ldquo;File Transfer Protocol,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1985.</span><span>)</span></a> did not provide the
   ability to do restarts in stream mode.  However, there is not really
   a need to have explicit restart markers in this case, as restart
   markers can be implied by the octet offset into the data stream.

</p>
<p>
   Because the data stream defines the file in STREAM mode, a different
   data stream would represent a different file.  Thus, an offset will
   always represent the same position within a file.  On the other hand,
   in other modes than STREAM, the same file can be transferred using
   quite different octet sequences and yet be reconstructed into the one
   identical file.  Thus an offset into the data stream in transfer
   modes other than STREAM would not give an unambiguous restart point.

</p>
<p>
   If the data representation TYPE is IMAGE and the STRUcture is File,
   for many systems the file will be stored exactly in the same format
   as it is sent across the data connection.  It is then usually very
   easy for the receiver to determine how much data was previously
   received, and notify the sender of the offset where the transfer
   should be restarted.  In other representation types and structures
   more effort will be required, but it remains always possible to
   determine the offset with finite, but perhaps non-negligible, effort.
   In the worst case, an FTP process may need to open a data connection
   to itself, set the appropriate transfer type and structure, and
   actually transmit the file, counting the transmitted octets.

</p>
<p>
   If the user-FTP process is intending to restart a retrieve, it will
   directly calculate the restart marker and send that information in
   the RESTart command.  However, if the user-FTP process is intending
   to restart sending the file, it needs to be able to determine how
   much data was previously sent, and correctly received and saved.  A
   new FTP command is needed to get this information.  This is the
   purpose of the SIZE command, as documented in <a class='info' href='#size'>Section&nbsp;4.1.5.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>File SIZE</span><span>)</span></a>.

Error Recovery and Restart</h3>

<p>
   STREAM mode transfers with FILE STRUcture may be restarted even
   though no restart marker has been transferred in addition to the data
   itself.  This is done by using the SIZE command, if needed, in
   combination with the RESTART (REST) command, and one of the standard
   file transfer commands.

</p>
<p>
   When using TYPE ASCII or IMAGE, the SIZE command will return the
   number of octets that would actually be transferred if the file were
   to be sent between the two systems, i.e., with type IMAGE, the SIZE
   normally would be the number of octets in the file.  With type ASCII,
   the SIZE would be the number of octets in the file including any
   modifications required to satisfy the TYPE ASCII CR-LF end-of-line
   convention.

Syntax</h3>

<p>
   The syntax for the REST command when the current transfer mode is
   STREAM is:

</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
      rest          = "Rest" SP 1*DIGIT CRLF
</pre></div><p>


</p>
<p>
   The numeric value gives the number of octets of the immediately-
   following transfer to not actually send, effectively causing the
   transmission to be restarted at a later point.  A value of zero
   effectively disables restart, causing the entire file to be
   transmitted.  The server-PI will respond to the REST command with a
   350 reply, indicating that the REST parameter has been saved, and
   that another command, which should be either RETR or STOR, should
   then follow to complete the restart.

</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
      rest-response = "350" SP *TCHAR CRLF /
                      error-response
</pre></div><p>


</p>
<p>
   Server-FTP processes may permit transfer commands other than RETR and
   STOR, such as APPE and STOU, to complete a restart; however, this is
   not recommended.  STOU (store unique) is undefined in this usage, as
   storing the remainder of a file into a unique file name is rarely
   going to be useful.  If APPE (append) is permitted, it MUST act
   identically to STOR when a restart marker has been set.  That is, in
   both cases, octets from the data connection are placed into the file
   at the location indicated by the restart marker value.

</p>
<p>
   The REST command is intended to complete a failed transfer.  Use with
   RETR is comparatively well defined in all cases, as the client bears
   the responsibility of merging the retrieved data with the partially
   retrieved file.  It may choose to use the data obtained other than to
   complete an earlier transfer, or to re-retrieve data that had been
   retrieved before.  With STOR, however, the server must insert the
   data into the file named.  The results are undefined if a client uses
   REST to do other than restart to complete a transfer of a file that
   had previously failed to completely transfer.  In particular, if the
   restart marker set with a REST command is not at the end of the data
   currently stored at the server, as reported by the server, or if
   insufficient data are provided in a STOR that follows a REST to
   extend the destination file to at least its previous size, then the
   effects are undefined.

</p>
<p>
   The REST command must be the last command issued before the data
   transfer command that is to cause a restarted, rather than a
   complete, file transfer.  The effect of issuing a REST command at any
   other time is undefined.  The server-PI may react to a badly
   positioned REST command by issuing an error response to the following
   command, not being a restartable data transfer command, or it may
   save the restart value and apply it to the next data transfer
   command, or it may silently ignore the inappropriate restart attempt.
   Because of this, a user-PI that has issued a REST command, but that
   has not successfully transmitted the following data transfer command
   for any reason, should send another REST command before the next data
   transfer command.  If that transfer is not to be restarted, then
   &quot;REST 0&quot; should be issued.

</p>
<p>
   An error response will follow a REST command only when the server
   does not implement the command, or when the restart marker value is
   syntactically invalid for the current transfer mode (e.g., in STREAM
   mode, something other than one or more digits appears in the
   parameter to the REST command).  Any other errors, including such
   problems as restart marker out of range, should be reported when the
   following transfer command is issued.  Such errors will cause that
   transfer request to be rejected with an error indicating the invalid
   restart attempt.

A Trivial Virtual File Store (TVFS)</h3>

<p>
   Traditionally, FTP has placed almost no constraints upon the file
   store (NVFS) provided by a server.  This specification does not alter
   that.  However, it has become common for servers to attempt to
   provide at least file system naming conventions modeled loosely upon
   those of the UNIX(TM) file system.  This is a tree-structured file
   system, built of directories, each of which can contain other
   directories, or other kinds of files, or both.  Each file and
   directory has a name relative to the directory that contains it,
   except for the directory at the root of the tree, which is contained
   in no other directory, and hence has no name of its own.

</p>
<p>
   That which has so far been described is perfectly consistent with the
   standard FTP NVFS and access mechanisms.  The &quot;CWD&quot; command is used
   to move from one directory to an embedded directory.  &quot;CDUP&quot; may be
   provided to return to the parent directory, and the various file
   manipulation commands (&quot;RETR&quot;, &quot;STOR&quot;, the rename commands, etc.) are
   used to manipulate files within the current directory.

</p>
<p>
   However, it is often useful to be able to reference files other than
   by changing directories, especially as FTP provides no guaranteed
   mechanism to return to a previous directory.  The Trivial Virtual
   File Store (TVFS), if implemented, provides that mechanism.

<a name="rfc.section.4.1.5.4.1"></a><h3>4.1.5.4.1.&nbsp;
TVFS File Names</h3>

<p>
   Where a server implements the TVFS, no elementary file name shall
   contain the character &quot;/&quot;.  Where the underlying natural file store
   permits files, or directories, to contain the &quot;/&quot; character in their
   names, a server-PI implementing TVFS must encode that character in
   some manner whenever file or directory names are being returned to
   the user-PI, and reverse that encoding whenever such names are being
   accepted from the user-PI.

</p>
<p>
   The encoding method to be used is not specified here.  Where some
   other character is illegal in file and directory names in the
   underlying file store, a simple transliteration may be sufficient.
   Where there is no suitable substitute character a more complex
   encoding scheme, possibly using an escape character, is likely to be
   required.

</p>
<p>
   With the one exception of the unnamed root directory, a TVFS file
   name may not be empty.  That is, all other file names contain at
   least one character.

</p>
<p>
   With the sole exception of the &quot;/&quot; character, any valid IS10646
   character [10] may be used in a TVFS file name.  When transmitted,
   file name characters are encoded using the UTF-8 encoding [2].  Note
   that the two-character sequence CR LF occurring in a file name will
   make that name impossible to transmit over a data connection.
   Consequently, it should be avoided, or if that is impossible to
   achieve, it MUST be encoded in some reversible way.

<a name="rfc.section.4.1.5.4.2"></a><h3>4.1.5.4.2.&nbsp;
TVFS Pathnames</h3>

<p>
   A TVFS &quot;Pathname&quot; combines the file or directory name of a target
   file or directory, with the directory names of zero or more enclosing
   directories, so as to allow the target file or directory to be
   referenced other than when the server's &quot;current working directory&quot;
   is the directory directly containing the target file or directory.

</p>
<p>
   By definition, every TVFS file or directory name is also a TVFS
   pathname.  Such a pathname is valid to reference the file from the
   directory containing the name, that is, when that directory is the
   server-FTP's current working directory.

</p>
<p>
   Other TVFS pathnames are constructed by prefixing a pathname by a
   name of a directory from which the path is valid, and separating the
   two with the &quot;/&quot; character.  Such a pathname is valid to reference
   the file or directory from the directory containing the newly added
   directory name.

</p>
<p>
   Where a pathname has been extended to the point where the directory
   added is the unnamed root directory, the pathname will begin with the
   &quot;/&quot; character.  Such a path is known as a fully qualified pathname.
   Fully qualified paths may, obviously, not be further extended, as, by
   definition, no directory contains the root directory.  Being unnamed,
   it cannot be represented in any other directory.  A fully qualified
   pathname is valid to reference the named file or directory from any
   location (that is, regardless of what the current working directory
   may be) in the virtual file store.

</p>
<p>
   Any pathname that is not a fully qualified pathname may be referred
   to as a &quot;relative pathname&quot; and will only correctly reference the
   intended file when the current working directory of the server-FTP is
   a directory from which the relative pathname is valid.

</p>
<p>
   As a special case, the pathname &quot;/&quot; is defined to be a fully
   qualified pathname referring to the root directory.  That is, the
   root directory does not have a directory (or file) name, but does
   have a pathname.  This special pathname may be used only as is as a
   reference to the root directory.  It may not be combined with other
   pathnames using the rules above, as doing so would lead to a pathname
   containing two consecutive &quot;/&quot; characters, which is an undefined
   sequence.

Notes</h3>

<p>
   +  It is not required, or expected, that there be only one fully
      qualified pathname that will reference any particular file or
      directory.

</p>
<p>
   +  As a caveat, though the TVFS file store is basically tree
      structured, there is no requirement that any file or directory
      have only one parent directory.

</p>
<p>
   +  As defined, no TVFS pathname will ever contain two consecutive &quot;/&quot;
      characters.  Such a name is not illegal however, and may be
      defined by the server for any purpose that suits it.  Clients
      implementing this specification should not assume any semantics
      for such names.

</p>
<p>
   +  Similarly, other than the special case path that refers to the
      root directory, no TVFS pathname constructed as defined here will
      ever end with the &quot;/&quot; character.  Such names are also not illegal,
      but are undefined.

</p>
<p>
   +  While any legal IS10646 character is permitted to occur in a TVFS
      file or directory name, other than &quot;/&quot;, server FTP implementations
      are not required to support all possible IS10646 characters.  The

</p>
<p>
      subset supported is entirely at the discretion of the server.  The
      case (where it exists) of the characters that make up file,
      directory, and pathnames may be significant.  Unless determined
      otherwise by means unspecified here, clients should assume that
      all such names are comprised of characters whose case is
      significant.  Servers are free to treat case (or any other
      attribute) of a name as irrelevant, and hence map two names that
      appear to be distinct onto the same underlying file.

</p>
<p>
   +  There are no defined &quot;magic&quot; names, like &quot;.&quot;, &quot;..&quot; or &quot;C:&quot;.
      Servers may implement such names, with any semantics they choose,
      but are not required to do so.

</p>
<p>
   +  TVFS imposes no particular semantics or properties upon files,
      guarantees no access control schemes, or any of the other common
      properties of a file store.  Only the naming scheme is defined.

   with the four characters &quot;TVFS&quot; (in any case, or mixture of cases,
   upper case is not required).  Servers SHOULD send upper case.

</p>
<p>
   Such a response to the FEAT command MUST NOT be returned unless the
   server implements TVFS as defined here.

</p>
<p>
   Later specifications may add to the TVFS definition.  Such additions
   should be notified by means of additional text appended to the TVFS
   feature line.  Such specifications, if any, will define the extra
   text.

</p>
<p>
   Until such a specification is defined, servers should not include
   anything after &quot;TVFS&quot; in the TVFS feature line.  Clients, however,

TVFS Examples</h3>

<p>
   Assume a TVFS file store is comprised of a root directory, which
   contains two directories (A and B) and two non-directory files (X and
   Y).  The A directory contains two directories (C and D) and one other
   file (Z).  The B directory contains just two non-directory files (P
   and Q) and the C directory also two non-directory files (also named P
   and Q, by chance).  The D directory is empty, that is, contains no
   files or directories.  This structure may depicted graphically as...

</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
            (unnamed root)

        / \
       /   \
      P     Q

</p>
<p>
   Given this structure, the following fully qualified pathnames exist.

         /B/Q

</p>
<p>
   It is clear that none of the paths / /A /B or /A/D refer to the same
   directory, as the contents of each is different.  Nor do any of / /A
   /A/C or /A/D.  However /A/C and /B might be the same directory, there
   is insufficient information given to tell.  Any of the other
   pathnames (/X /Y /A/Z /A/C/P /A/C/Q /B/P and /B/Q) may refer to the
   same underlying files, in almost any combination.

</p>
<p>
   If the current working directory of the server-FTP is /A then the
   following pathnames, in addition to all the fully qualified
   pathnames, are valid

</p>
<p>
   These all refer to the same files or directories as the corresponding
   fully qualified path with &quot;/A/&quot; prepended.

</p>
<p>
   That those pathnames all exist does not imply that the TVFS server
   will necessarily grant any kind of access rights to the named paths,
   or that access to the same file via different pathnames will
   necessarily be granted equal rights.

</p>
<p>
   None of the following relative paths are valid when the current

Listings for Machine Processing (MLST and MLSD)</h3>

<p>
   The MLST and MLSD commands are intended to standardize the file and
   directory information returned by the server-FTP process.  These
   commands differ from the LIST command in that the format of the
   replies is strictly defined although extensible.

</p>
<p>
   Two commands are defined, MLST and MLSD.  MLST provides data about
   exactly the object named on its command line, and no others.  MLSD,
   on the other, lists the contents of a directory if a directory is
   named, otherwise a 501 reply is returned.  In either case, if no
   object is named, the current directory is assumed.  That will cause
   MLST to send a one-line response, describing the current directory
   itself, and MLSD to list the contents of the current directory.

</p>
<p>
   In the following, the term MLSx will be used wherever either MLST or
   MLSD may be inserted.

</p>
<p>
   The MLST and MLSD commands also extend the FTP protocol as presented
   in STD 9, <a class='info' href='#RFC0959'>[RFC0959]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J. and J. Reynolds, &ldquo;File Transfer Protocol,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1985.</span><span>)</span></a> and STD 3, <a class='info' href='#RFC1123'>[RFC1123]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Braden, R., &ldquo;Requirements for Internet Hosts - Application and Support,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1989.</span><span>)</span></a> to allow the
   transmission of 8-bit data over the control connection.  Note this is
   not specifying character sets which are 8-bit, but specifying that
   FTP implementations are to specifically allow the transmission and
   reception of 8-bit bytes, with all bits significant, over the control
   connection.  That is, all 256 possible octet values are permitted.
   The MLSx command allows both UTF-8/Unicode and &quot;raw&quot; forms as
   arguments, and in responses both to the MLST and MLSD commands, and
   all other FTP commands which take pathnames as arguments.

<a name="rfc.section.4.1.5.5.1"></a><h3>4.1.5.5.1.&nbsp;
Format of MLSx Requests</h3>

<p>
   The MLST and MLSD commands each allow a single optional argument.
   This argument may be either a directory name or, for MLST only, a
   file name.  For these purposes, a &quot;file name&quot; is the name of any
   entity in the server NVFS which is not a directory.  Where TVFS is
   supported, any TVFS relative pathname valid in the current working
   directory, or any TVFS fully qualified pathname, may be given.  If a
   directory name is given then MLSD must return a listing of the
   contents of the named directory, otherwise it issues a 501 reply, and
   does not open a data connection.  In all cases for MLST, a single set
   of fact lines (usually a single fact line) containing the information
   about the named file or directory shall be returned over the control
   connection, without opening a data connection.

</p>
<p>
   If no argument is given then MLSD must return a listing of the
   contents of the current working directory, and MLST must return a
   listing giving information about the current working directory
   itself.  For these purposes, the contents of a directory are whatever
   file or directory names (not pathnames) the server-PI will allow to
   be referenced when the current working directory is the directory
   named, and which the server-PI desires to reveal to the user-PI.
   Note that omitting the argument is the only defined way to obtain a
   listing of the current directory, unless a pathname that represents
   the directory happens to be known.  In particular, there is no
   defined shorthand name for the current directory.  This does not
   prohibit any particular server-PI implementing such a shorthand.

</p>
<p>
   No title, header, or summary, lines, or any other formatting, other
   than as is specified below, is ever returned in the output of an MLST
   or MLSD command.

</p>
<p>
   If the Client-FTP sends an invalid argument, the server-FTP MUST
   reply with an error code of 501.

Format of MLSx Response</h3>

<p>
   The format of a response to an MLSx command is as follows:

</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
      mlst-response    = control-response / error-response
      mlsd-response    = ( initial-response final-response ) /
                         error-response

      control-response = "250-" [ response-message ] CRLF
                         1*( SP entry CRLF )
                         "250" [ SP response-message ] CRLF

      initial-response = "150" [ SP response-message ] CRLF
      final-response   = "226" SP response-message CRLF

      response-message = *TCHAR

      data-response    = *( entry CRLF )

      entry            = [ facts ] SP pathname
      facts            = 1*( fact ";" )
      fact             = factname "=" value
      factname         = "Size" / "Modify" / "Create" /
                         "Type" / "Unique" / "Perm" /
                         "Lang" / "Media-Type" / "CharSet" /
                         os-depend-fact / local-fact
      os-depend-fact   = &lt;IANA assigned OS name&gt; "." token

      local-fact       = "X." token
      value            = *SCHAR
</pre></div><p>


</p>
<p>
   Upon receipt of an MLSx command, the server will verify the
   parameter, and if invalid return an error-response.  For this
   purpose, the parameter should be considered to be invalid if the
   client issuing the command does not have permission to perform the
   requested operation.

</p>
<p>
   If the parameter is valid, then for an MLST command, the server-PI
   will send the first (leading) line of the control response, the entry
   for the pathname given, or the current directory if no pathname was
   provided, and the terminating line.  Normally exactly one entry would
   be returned, more entries are permitted only when required to
   represent a file that is to have multiple &quot;Type&quot; facts returned.  In
   this case, the pathname component of every response MUST be
   identical.

</p>
<p>
   Note that for MLST the fact set is preceded by a space.  That is
   provided to guarantee that the fact set cannot be accidentally
   interpreted as the terminating line of the control response, but is
   required even when that would not be possible.  Exactly one space
   exists between the set of facts and the pathname.  Where no facts are
   present, there will be exactly two leading spaces before the
   pathname.  No spaces are permitted in the facts, any other spaces in
   the response are to be treated as being a part of the pathname.

</p>
<p>
   If the command was an MLSD command, the server will open a data
   connection as indicated in section 3.2 of STD 9, <a class='info' href='#RFC0959'>[RFC0959]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J. and J. Reynolds, &ldquo;File Transfer Protocol,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1985.</span><span>)</span></a>.  If
   that fails, the server will return an error-response.  If all is OK,
   the server will return the initial-response, send the appropriate
   data-response over the new data connection, close that connection,
   and then send the final-response over the control connection.  The
   grammar above defines the format for the data-response, which defines
   the format of the data returned over the data connection established.

</p>
<p>
   The data connection opened for a MLSD response shall be a connection
   as if the &quot;TYPE L 8&quot;, &quot;MODE S&quot;, and &quot;STRU F&quot; commands had been given,
   whatever FTP transfer type, mode and structure had actually been set,
   and without causing those settings to be altered for future commands.
   That is, this transfer type shall be set for the duration of the data
   connection established for this command only.  While the content of
   the data sent can be viewed as a series of lines, implementations
   should note that there is no maximum line length defined.
   Implementations should be prepared to deal with arbitrarily long
   lines.

</p>
<p>
   The facts part of the specification would contain a series of &quot;file
   facts&quot; about the file or directory named on the same line.  Typical
   information to be presented would include file size, last
   modification time, creation time, a unique identifier, and a
   file/directory flag.

</p>
<p>
   The complete format for a successful reply to the MLSD command would
   be:

</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
      facts SP pathname CRLF
      facts SP pathname CRLF
      facts SP pathname CRLF
      ...
</pre></div><p>


</p>
<p>
   Note that the format is intended for machine processing, not human
   viewing, and as such the format is very rigid.  Implementations MUST
   NOT vary the format by, for example, inserting extra spaces for
   readability, replacing spaces by tabs, including header or title
   lines, or inserting blank lines, or in any other way alter this
   format.  Exactly one space is always required after the set of facts
   (which may be empty).  More spaces may be present on a line if, and
   only if, the pathname presented contains significant spaces.  The set
   of facts must not contain any spaces anywhere inside it.  Facts
   should be provided in each output line only if they both provide
   relevant information about the file named on the same line, and they
   are in the set requested by the user-PI.  See <a class='info' href='#mlst-opts'>Section&nbsp;4.1.5.5.9<span> (</span><span class='info'>OPTS Parameters for MLST</span><span>)</span></a>.
   There is no requirement that the same set of facts be provided for
   each file, or that the facts presented occur in the same order for
   each file.

File Name Encoding</h3>

<p>
   An FTP implementation supporting the MLSx commands must be 8-bit
   clean.  This is necessary in order to transmit UTF-8 encoded file
   names.  This specification recommends the use of UTF-8 encoded file
   names.  FTP implementations SHOULD use UTF-8 whenever possible to
   encourage the maximum inter-operability.

</p>
<p>
   File names are not restricted to UTF-8, however treatment of
   arbitrary character encodings is not specified by this standard.
   Applications are encouraged to treat non-UTF-8 encodings of file
   names as octet sequences.

</p>
<p>
   Note that this encoding is unrelated to that of the contents of the
   file, even if the file contains character data.

</p>
<p>
   Further information about file name encoding for FTP may be found in
   &quot;Internationalization of the File Transfer Protocol&quot; <a class='info' href='#RFC2640'>[RFC2640]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Curtin, B., &ldquo;Internationalization of the File Transfer Protocol,&rdquo; July&nbsp;1999.</span><span>)</span></a>.

Notes about the File Name</h3>

<p>
   The file name returned in the MLST response should be the same name
   as was specified in the MLST command, or, where TVFS is supported, a
   fully qualified TVFS path naming the same file.  Where no argument
   was given to the MLST command, the server-PI may either include an
   empty file name in the response, or it may supply a name that refers
   to the current directory, if such a name is available.  Where TVFS is
   supported, a fully qualified pathname of the current directory SHOULD
   be returned.

</p>
<p>
   File names returned in the output from an MLSD command SHOULD be
   unqualified names within the directory named, or the current
   directory if no argument was given.  That is, the directory named in
   the MLSD command SHOULD NOT appear as a component of the file names
   returned.

</p>
<p>
   If the server-FTP process is able, and the &quot;type&quot; fact is being
   returned, it MAY return in the MLSD response, an entry whose type is
   &quot;cdir&quot;, which names the directory from which the contents of the
   listing were obtained.  Where TVFS is supported, the name MAY be the
   fully qualified pathname of the directory, or MAY be any other
   pathname that is valid to refer to that directory from the current
   working directory of the server-FTP.  Where more than one name
   exists, multiple of these entries may be returned.  In a sense, the
   &quot;cdir&quot; entry can be viewed as a heading for the MLSD output.
   However, it is not required to be the first entry returned, and may
   occur anywhere within the listing.

</p>
<p>
   When TVFS is supported, a user-PI can refer to any file or directory
   in the listing by combining a type &quot;cdir&quot; name, with the appropriate
   name from the directory listing using the procedure defined in
   <a class='info' href='#tvfspathnames'>Section&nbsp;4.1.5.4.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>TVFS Pathnames</span><span>)</span></a>.

</p>
<p>
   Alternatively, whether TVFS is supported or not, the user-PI can
   issue a CWD command (<a class='info' href='#RFC0959'>[RFC0959]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J. and J. Reynolds, &ldquo;File Transfer Protocol,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1985.</span><span>)</span></a>) giving a name of type &quot;cdir&quot; from the
   listing returned, and from that point reference the files returned in
   the MLSD response from which the cdir was obtained by using the file
   name components of the listing.

Format of Facts</h3>

<p>
   The &quot;facts&quot; for a file in a reply to a MLSx command consist of
   information about that file.  The facts are a series of keyword=value
   pairs each followed by semi-colon (&quot;;&quot;) characters.  An individual
   fact may not contain a semi-colon in its name or value.  The complete
   series of facts may not contain the space character.  See the

Standard Facts</h3>

<p>
   This document defines a standard set of facts as follows:

</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
    size       -- Size in octets
    modify     -- Last modification time
    create     -- Creation time
    type       -- Entry type
    unique     -- Unique id of file/directory
    perm       -- File permissions, whether read, write, execute is
                  allowed for the login id.
    lang       -- Language of the file name per IANA [11] registry.
    media-type -- MIME media-type of file contents per IANA registry.
    charset    -- Character set per IANA registry (if not UTF-8)
</pre></div><p>


</p>
<p>
   Fact names are case-insensitive.  Size, size, SIZE, and SiZe are the
   same fact.

</p>
<p>
   Further operating system specific keywords could be specified by
   using the IANA operating system name as a prefix (examples only):

</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
      OS/2.ea   -- OS/2 extended attributes
      MACOS.rf  -- MacIntosh resource forks
      UNIX.mode -- Unix file modes (permissions)
</pre></div><p>


</p>
<p>
   Implementations may define keywords for experimental, or private use.
   All such keywords MUST begin with the two character sequence &quot;x.&quot;.
   As type names are case independent, &quot;x.&quot; and &quot;X.&quot; are equivalent.
   For example:

</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>

<a name="rfc.section.4.1.5.5.5.1"></a><h3>4.1.5.5.5.1.&nbsp;
The Type Fact</h3>

<p>
   The type fact needs a special description.  Part of the problem with
   current practices is deciding when a file is a directory.  If it is a
   directory, is it the current directory, a regular directory, or a
   parent directory?  The MLST specification makes this unambiguous
   using the type fact.  The type fact given specifies information about
   the object listed on the same line of the MLST response.

</p>
<p>
   Five values are possible for the type fact:

</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
      file         -- a file entry
      cdir         -- the listed directory
      pdir         -- a parent directory
      dir          -- a directory or sub-directory
      OS.name=type -- an OS or file system dependent file type
</pre></div><p>


</p>
<p>
   The syntax is defined to be:

</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
      type-fact       = type-label "=" type-val
      type-label      = "Type"
      type-val        = "File" / "cdir" / "pdir" / "dir" /
                        os-type
</pre></div><p>


</p>
<p>
   The value of the type fact (the &quot;type-val&quot;) is a case independent
   string.

</p>
<a name="anchor29"></a><br /><hr />

<a name="rfc.section.4.1.5.5.5.1.1"></a><h3>4.1.5.5.5.1.1.&nbsp;
type=file</h3>

<p>
   The presence of the type=file fact indicates the listed entry is a
   file containing non-system data.  That is, it may be transferred from
   one system to another of quite different characteristics, and perhaps
   still be meaningful.

</p>
<a name="anchor30"></a><br /><hr />

<a name="rfc.section.4.1.5.5.5.1.2"></a><h3>4.1.5.5.5.1.2.&nbsp;
type=cdir</h3>

<p>
   The type=cdir fact indicates the listed entry contains a pathname of
   the directory whose contents are listed.  An entry of this type will
   only be returned as a part of the result of an MLSD command when the

</p>
<p>
   type fact is included, and provides a name for the listed directory,
   and facts about that directory.  In a sense, it can be viewed as
   representing the title of the listing, in a machine friendly format.
   It may appear at any point of the listing, it is not restricted to
   appearing at the start, though frequently may do so, and may occur
   multiple times.  It MUST NOT be included if the type fact is not
   included, or there would be no way for the user-PI to distinguish the
   name of the directory from an entry in the directory.

</p>
<p>
   Where TVFS is supported by the server-FTP, this name may be used to
   construct pathnames with which to refer to the files and directories
   returned in the same MLSD output (see <a class='info' href='#tvfspathnames'>Section&nbsp;4.1.5.4.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>TVFS Pathnames</span><span>)</span></a>).  These pathnames
   are only expected to work when the server-PI's position in the NVFS
   file tree is the same as its position when the MLSD command was
   issued, unless a fully qualified pathname results.

</p>
<p>
   Where TVFS is not supported, the only defined semantics associated
   with a &quot;type=cdir&quot; entry are that, provided the current working
   directory of the server-PI has not been changed, a pathname of type
   &quot;cdir&quot; may be used as an argument to a CWD command, which will cause
   the current directory of the server-PI to change so that the
   directory that was listed in its current working directory.

type=dir</h3>

<p>
   If present, the type=dir entry gives the name of a directory.  Such
   an entry typically cannot be transferred from one system to another
   using RETR, etc., but should (permissions permitting) be able to be
   the object of an MLSD command.

</p>

type=pdir</h3>

<p>
   If present, which will occur only in the response to a MLSD command
   when the type fact is included, the type=pdir entry represents a
   pathname of the parent directory of the listed directory.  As well as
   having the properties of a type=dir, a CWD command that uses the
   pathname from this entry should change the user to a parent directory
   of the listed directory.  If the listed directory is the current
   directory, a CDUP command may also have the effect of changing to the
   named directory.  User-FTP processes should note not all responses
   will include this information, and that some systems may provide
   multiple type=pdir responses.

</p>
<p>
   Where TVFS is supported, a &quot;type=pdir&quot; name may be a relative
   pathname, or a fully qualified pathname.  A relative pathname will be
   relative to the directory being listed, not to the current directory
   of the server-PI at the time.

</p>
<p>
   For the purposes of this type value, a &quot;parent directory&quot; is any
   directory in which there is an entry of type=dir that refers to the
   directory in which the type=pdir entity was found.  Thus it is not
   required that all entities with type=pdir refer to the same
   directory.  The &quot;unique&quot; fact (if supported and supplied) can be used
   to determine whether there is a relationship between the type=pdir
   entries or not.

System Defined Types</h3>

<p>
   Files types that are specific to a specific operating system, or file
   system, can be encoded using the &quot;OS.&quot; type names.  The format is:

</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
      os-type   = "OS." os-name "=" os-kind
      os-name   = &lt;an IANA registered operating system name&gt;
      os-kind   = token
</pre></div><p>


</p>
<p>
   The &quot;os-name&quot; indicates the specific system type that supports the
   particular localtype.  OS specific types are registered by the IANA
   using the procedures specified in section 10.  The &quot;os-kind&quot; provides
   the system dependent information as to the type of the file listed.
   The os-name and os-kind strings in an os-type are case independent.
   &quot;OS.unix=block&quot; and &quot;OS.Unix=BLOCK&quot; represent the same type (or
   would, if such a type were registered.)

</p>
<p>
   Note: Where the underlying system supports a file type that is
   essentially an indirect pointer to another file, the NVFS
   representation of that type should normally be to represent the file
   that the reference indicates.  That is, the underlying basic file
   will appear more than once in the NVFS, each time with the &quot;unique&quot;
   fact (see immediately following section) containing the same value,
   indicating that the same file is represented by all such names.
   User-PIs transferring the file need then transfer it only once, and
   then insert their own form of indirect reference to construct
   alternate names where desired, or perhaps even copy the local file if
   that is the only way to provide two names with the same content.  A
   file which would be a reference to another file, if only the other
   file actually existed, may be represented in any OS dependent manner
   appropriate, or not represented at all.

Multiple Types</h3>

<p>
   Where a file is such that it may validly, and sensibly, treated by
   the server-PI as being of more than one of the above types, then
   multiple entries should be returned, each with its own &quot;Type&quot; fact of
   the appropriate type, and each containing the same pathname.  This
   may occur, for example, with a structured file, which may contain
   sub-files, and where the server-PI permits the structured file to be

</p>
<p>
   treated as a unit, or treated as a directory allowing the sub-files
   within it to be referenced.  When this is done, the pathname returned
   with each entry MUST be identical to the others representing the same
   file.

   directory in the NVFS accessed via a server-FTP process.  The value
   of this fact should be the same for any number of pathnames that
   refer to the same underlying file.  The fact should have different
   values for names that reference distinct files.  The mapping between
   files, and unique fact tokens should be maintained, and remain
   consistent, for at least the lifetime of the control connection from
   user-PI to server-PI.

</p>
<p>
   This fact would be expected to be used by server-FTPs whose host
   system allows things such as symbolic links so that the same file may
   be represented in more than one directory on the server.  The only
   conclusion that should be drawn is that if two different names each
   have the same value for the unique fact, they refer to the same
   underlying object.  The value of the unique fact (the token) should
   be considered an opaque string for comparison purposes, and is a case
   dependent value.  The tokens &quot;A&quot; and &quot;a&quot; do not represent the same
   underlying object.

The modify Fact</h3>

<p>
   The modify fact is used to determine the last time the content of the
   file (or directory) indicated was modified.  Any change of substance
   to the file should cause this value to alter.  That is, if a change
   is made to a file such that the results of a RETR command would
   differ, then the value of the modify fact should alter.  User-PIs
   should not assume that a different modify fact value indicates that
   the file contents are necessarily different than when last retrieved.
   Some systems may alter the value of the modify fact for other
   reasons, though this is discouraged wherever possible.  Also a file
   may alter, and then be returned to its previous content, which would
   often be indicated as two incremental alterations to the value of the
   modify fact.

</p>
<p>
   For directories, this value should alter whenever a change occurs to
   the directory such that different file names would (or might) be
   included in MLSD output of that directory.

The create Fact</h3>

<p>
   The create fact indicates when a file, or directory, was first
   created.  Exactly what &quot;creation&quot; is for this purpose is not
   specified here, and may vary from server to server.  About all that
   can be said about the value returned is that it can never indicate a
   later time than the modify fact.

<p>
   Implementation Note: Implementors of this fact on UNIX(TM) systems
      should note that the unix &quot;stat&quot; &quot;st_ctime&quot; field does not give
      creation time, and that unix file systems do not record creation
      time at all.  Unix (and POSIX) implementations will normally not
      include this fact.

</p>
<p>
   There are ten permission indicators currently defined.  Many are
   meaningful only when used with a particular type of object.  The
   indicators are case independent, &quot;d&quot; and &quot;D&quot; are the same indicator.

</p>
<p>
   The &quot;a&quot; permission applies to objects of type=file, and indicates
   that the APPE (append) command may be applied to the file named.

</p>
<p>
   The &quot;c&quot; permission applies to objects of type=dir (and type=pdir,
   type=cdir).  It indicates that files may be created in the directory
   named.  That is, that a STOU command is likely to succeed, and that
   STOR and APPE commands might succeed if the file named did not
   previously exist, but is to be created in the directory object that
   has the &quot;c&quot; permission.  It also indicates that the RNTO command is
   likely to succeed for names in the directory.

</p>
<p>
   The &quot;d&quot; permission applies to all types.  It indicates that the
   object named may be deleted, that is, that the RMD command may be
   applied to it if it is a directory, and otherwise that the DELE
   command may be applied to it.

</p>
<p>
   The &quot;e&quot; permission applies to the directory types.  When set on an
   object of type=dir, type=cdir, or type=pdir it indicates that a CWD
   command naming the object should succeed, and the user should be able
   to enter the directory named.  For type=pdir it also indicates that
   the CDUP command may succeed (if this particular pathname is the one
   to which a CDUP would apply.)

</p>
<p>
   The &quot;f&quot; permission for objects indicates that the object named may be
   renamed - that is, may be the object of an RNFR command.

</p>
<p>
   The &quot;l&quot; permission applies to the directory file types, and indicates
   that the listing commands, LIST, NLST, and MLSD may be applied to the
   directory in question.

</p>
<p>
   The &quot;m&quot; permission applies to directory types, and indicates that the
   MKD command may be used to create a new directory within the
   directory under consideration.

</p>
<p>
   The &quot;p&quot; permission applies to directory types, and indicates that
   objects in the directory may be deleted, or (stretching naming a
   little) that the directory may be purged.  Note: it does not indicate
   that the RMD command may be used to remove the directory named
   itself, the &quot;d&quot; permission indicator indicates that.

</p>
<p>
   The &quot;r&quot; permission applies to type=file objects, and for some
   systems, perhaps to other types of objects, and indicates that the
   RETR command may be applied to that object.

</p>
<p>
   The &quot;w&quot; permission applies to type=file objects, and for some
   systems, perhaps to other types of objects, and indicates that the
   STOR command may be applied to the object named.

</p>
<p>
   Note: That a permission indicator is set can never imply that the
      appropriate command is guaranteed to work -- just that it might.
      Other system specific limitations, such as limitations on
      available space for storing files, may cause an operation to fail,
      where the permission flags may have indicated that it was likely
      to succeed.  The permissions are a guide only.

</p>
<p>
   Implementation note: The permissions are described here as they apply
      to FTP commands.  They may not map easily into particular
      permissions available on the server's operating system.  Servers
      are expected to synthesize these permission bits from the
      permission information available from operating system.  For
      example, to correctly determine whether the &quot;D&quot; permission bit
      should be set on a directory for a server running on the UNIX(TM)
      operating system, the server should check that the directory named
      is empty, and that the user has write permission on both the
      directory under consideration, and its parent directory.

</p>
<p>
      Some systems may have more specific permissions than those listed
      here, such systems should map those to the flags defined as best
      they are able.  Other systems may have only more broad access
      controls.  They will generally have just a few possible
      permutations of permission flags, however they should attempt to
      correctly represent what is permitted.

The lang Fact</h3>

<p>
   The lang fact describes the natural language of the file name for use
   in display purposes.  Values used here should be taken from the
   language registry of the IANA.  See [12] for the syntax, and
   procedures, related to language tags.

</p>
<p>
   Server-FTP implementations MUST NOT guess language values.  Language
   values must be determined in an unambiguous way such as file system
   tagging of language or by user configuration.  Note that the lang
   fact provides no information at all about the content of a file, only
   about the encoding of its name.

<a name="rfc.section.4.1.5.5.5.7"></a><h3>4.1.5.5.5.7.&nbsp;
The size Fact</h3>

<p>
   The size fact applies to non-directory file types and should always
   reflect the approximate size of the file.  This should be as accurate
   as the server can make it, without going to extraordinary lengths,
   such as reading the entire file.  The size is expressed in units of
   octets of data in the file.

</p>
<p>
   Given limitations in some systems, Client-FTP implementations must
   understand this size may not be precise and may change between the
   time of a MLST and RETR operation.

</p>
<p>
   Clients that need highly accurate size information for some
   particular reason should use the SIZE command as defined in <a class='info' href='#size'>Section&nbsp;4.1.5.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>File SIZE</span><span>)</span></a>.
   The most common need for this accuracy is likely to be in
   conjunction with the REST command described in <a class='info' href='#rest'>Section&nbsp;4.1.5.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Restart of Interrupted Transfer (REST)</span><span>)</span></a>.  The size
   fact, on the other hand, should be used for purposes such as
   indicating to a human user the approximate size of the file to be
   transferred, and perhaps to give an idea of expected transfer
   completion time.

   system tagging of media-type or by user configuration.  This fact

System Dependent Facts</h3>

<p>
   System dependent fact names are labeled by prefixing a label
   identifying the specific information returned by the name of the
   appropriate operating system from the IANA maintained list of
   operating system names.

</p>
<p>
   The value of an OS dependent fact may be whatever is appropriate to

</p>
<p>
   In order to allow reliable inter-operation between users of system
   dependent facts, the IANA will maintain a registry of system
   dependent fact names, their syntax, and the interpretation to be
   given to their values.  Registrations of system dependent facts are

Local Facts</h3>

<p>
   Implementations may also make available other facts of their own
   choosing.  As the method of interpretation of such information will
   generally not be widely understood, server-PIs should be aware that
   clients will typically ignore any local facts provided.  As there is
   no registration of locally defined facts, it is entirely possible
   that different servers will use the same local fact name to provide
   vastly different information.  Hence user-PIs should be hesitant
   about making any use of any information in a locally defined fact
   without some other specific assurance that the particular fact is one
   that they do comprehend.

</p>
<p>
   Local fact names all begin with the sequence &quot;X.&quot;.  The rest of the
   name is a &quot;token&quot; (see <a class='info' href='#sec-2.1'>Section&nbsp;2.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Basic Tokens</span><span>)</span></a>).  The value of a local fact can

MLSx Examples</h3>

<p>
   The following examples are all taken from dialogues between existing
   FTP clients and servers.  Because of this, not all possible
   variations of possible response formats are shown in the examples.
   This should not be taken as limiting the options of other server
   implementors.  Where the examples show OS dependent information, that
   is to be treated as being purely for the purposes of demonstration of
   some possible OS specific information that could be defined.  As at
   the time of the writing of this document, no OS specific facts or
   file types have been defined, the examples shown here should not be
   treated as in any way to be preferred over other possible similar
   definitions.  Consult the IANA registries to determine what types and
   facts have been defined.  Finally also beware that as the examples
   shown are taken from existing implementations, coded before this
   document was completed, the possibility of variations between the
   text of this document and the examples exists.  In any such case of
   inconsistency, the example is to be treated as incorrect.

</p>
<p>
   In the examples shown, only relevant commands and responses have been
   included.  This is not to imply that other commands (including
   authentication, directory modification, PORT or PASV commands, or
   similar) would not be present in an actual connection, or were not,
   in fact, actually used in the examples before editing.  Note also
   that the formats shown are those that are transmitted between client
   and server, not formats that would normally ever be reported to the
   user of the client.

   The client first asked to be told the current directory of the

   The client then requested facts about a specific file.  The server
   returned the &quot;250-&quot; first control-response line, followed by a single
   line of facts about the file, followed by the terminating &quot;250 &quot;
   line.  The text on the control-response line and the terminating line
   can be anything the server decides to send.  Notice that the fact

</p>
<p>
   For the purposes of this example the fact set requested has been
   modified to delete the &quot;size&quot; and &quot;modify&quot; facts, and add the
   &quot;unique&quot; fact.  First, facts about a file name have been obtained via
   MLST.  Note that no fully qualified pathname was given this time.
   That was because the server was unable to determine that information.
   Then having determined that the file name represents a directory,
   that directory has been listed.  That listing also shows no fully
   qualified pathname, for the same reason, thus has but a single
   &quot;type=cdir&quot; line.  This directory (which was created especially for
   the purpose) contains several interesting files.  There are some with
   OS dependent file types, several sub-directories, and several
   ordinary files.

</p>
<p>
   Not much can be said here about the OS dependent file types, as none
   of the information shown there should be treated as any more than
   possibilities.  It can be seen that the OS type of the server is
   &quot;unix&quot; though, which is one of the OS types in the IANA registry of
   Operating System names.

</p>
<p>
   Of the three directories listed, &quot;no-exec&quot; has no permission granted
   to this user to access at all.  From the &quot;Unique&quot; fact values, it can
   be determined that &quot;promiscuous&quot; and &quot;incoming&quot; in fact represent the
   same directory.  Its permissions show that the connected user has
   permission to do essentially anything other than to delete the
   directory.  That directory was later listed.  It happens that the
   directory can not be deleted because it is not empty.

</p>
<p>
   Of the normal files listed, two contain spaces in their names.  The
   file called &quot; leading space&quot; actually contains two spaces in its
   name, one before the &quot;l&quot; and one between the &quot;g&quot; and the &quot;s&quot;.  The
   two spaces that separate the facts from the visible part of the
   pathname make that clear.  The file &quot;writable&quot; has the &quot;a&quot; and &quot;w&quot;
   permission bits set, and consequently the connected user should be
   able to STOR or APPE to that file.

</p>
<p>
   The other four file names, &quot;file1&quot;, &quot;file2&quot;, &quot;file3&quot;, and &quot;file4&quot; all
   represent the same underlying file, as can be seen from the values of
   the &quot;unique&quot; facts of each.  It happens that &quot;file1&quot; and &quot;file2&quot; are
   Unix &quot;hard&quot; links, and that &quot;file3&quot; and &quot;file4&quot; are &quot;soft&quot; or
   &quot;symbolic&quot; links to the first two.  None of that information is
   available via standard MLST facts, it is sufficient for the purposes
   of FTP to note that all represent the same file, and that the same
   data would be fetched no matter which of them was retrieved, and that
   all would be simultaneously modified were data stored in any.

</p>
<p>
   Finally, the sub-directory &quot;incoming&quot; is listed.  Since &quot;promiscuous&quot;
   is the same directory there would be no point listing it as well.  In
   that directory, the files &quot;file5&quot; and &quot;file6&quot; represent still more
   names for the &quot;file1&quot; file we have seen before.  Notice the entry
   between that for &quot;bar&quot; and &quot;file5&quot;.  Though it is not possible to
   easily represent it in this document, that shows a file with a name
   comprising exactly three spaces (&quot;   &quot;).  A client will have no
   difficulty determining that name from the output presented to it
   however.  The directory &quot;empty&quot; is, as its name implies, empty,
   though that is not shown here.  It can, however, be deleted, as can
   file &quot;bar&quot; and the file whose name is three spaces.  All the files
   that reside in this directory can be renamed.  This is a consequence
   of the UNIX semantics of the directory that contains them being
   modifiable.

A Stress Test of Case (In)dependence</h3>

<p>
   The following example is intended to make clear some cases where case
   dependent strings are permitted in the MLSx commands, and where case
   independent strings are required.

</p>
<p>
   Note first that the &quot;MLSD&quot; command, shown here as &quot;MlsD&quot; is case
   independent.  Clients may issue this command in any case, or
   combination of cases, they desire.  This is the case for all FTP
   commands.

</p>
<p>
   Next, notice the labels of the facts.  These are also case-
   independent strings; the server-FTP is permitted to return them in
   any case desired.  User-FTP must be prepared to deal with any case,
   though it may do this by mapping the labels to a common case if
   desired.

</p>
<p>
   Then, notice that there are nine objects of &quot;type&quot; file returned.  In
   a case-independent NVFS these would represent three different file
   names, &quot;file1&quot;, &quot;file2&quot;, and &quot;file3&quot;.  With a case-dependent NVFS all
   nine represent different file names.  Either is possible, server-FTPs
   may implement a case dependent or a case independent NVFS.  User-FTPs
   must allow for case dependent selection of files to manipulate on the
   server.

</p>
<p>
   Lastly, notice that the value of the &quot;unique&quot; fact is case dependent.
   In the example shown, &quot;file1&quot;, &quot;File1&quot;, and &quot;file2&quot; all have the same
   &quot;unique&quot; fact value &quot;keVO1+bD8&quot;, and thus all represent the same
   underlying file.  On the other hand, &quot;FILE1&quot; has a different &quot;unique&quot;
   fact value (&quot;keVO1+bd8&quot;) and hence represents a different file.
   Similarly, &quot;FILE2&quot; and &quot;File2&quot; are two names for the same underlying
   file, whereas &quot;file3&quot;, &quot;File3&quot; and &quot;FILE3&quot; all represent different
   underlying files.

</p>
<p>
   That the approximate sizes (&quot;size&quot; fact) and last modification times
   (&quot;modify&quot; fact) are the same in all cases might be no more than a
   coincidence.

</p>
<p>
   It is not suggested that the operators of server-FTPs create an NVFS
   that stresses the protocols to this extent; however, both user and
   server implementations must be prepared to deal with such extreme
   examples.

   Note that this server gives fully qualified pathnames for the &quot;pdir&quot;
   and &quot;cdir&quot; entries in MLSD listings.  Also notice that this server
   does, though it is not required to, sort its directory listing
   outputs.  That may be an artifact of the underlying file system
   access mechanisms of course.  Finally notice that the NVFS supported
   by this server, in contrast to the earlier ones, implements its
   pathnames in a case independent manner.  The server seems to return
   files using the case in which they were requested, when the name was
   sent by the client, and otherwise uses an algorithm known only to
   itself to select the case of the names it returns.

   The server shown here returns its directory listings in seemingly
   random order, and even seems to modify the order of the directory as
   its contents change -- perhaps the underlying directory structure is
   based upon hashing of some kind.  Note that the &quot;pdir&quot; and &quot;cdir&quot;
   entries are interspersed with other entries in the directory.  Note
   also that this server does not show a &quot;pdir&quot; entry when listing the
   contents of the root directory of the virtual filestore; however, it
   does however include multiple &quot;cdir&quot; and &quot;pdir&quot; entries when it feels
   inclined.  The server also uses obnoxiously &quot;cute&quot; messages.

FEAT Response for MLSx</h3>

<p>
   When responding to the FEAT command, a server-FTP process that
   supports MLST, and MLSD, plus internationalization of pathnames, MUST
   indicate that this support exists.  It does this by including a MLST
   feature line.  As well as indicating the basic support, the MLST
   feature line indicates which MLST facts are available from the
   server, and which of those will be returned if no subsequent &quot;OPTS
   MLST&quot; command is sent.

</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
      mlst-feat     = SP "MLST" [SP factlist] CRLF
      factlist      = 1*( factname ["*"] ";" )
</pre></div><p>


</p>
<p>
   The initial space shown in the mlst-feat response is that required by
   the FEAT command, two spaces are not permitted.  If no factlist is
   given, then the server-FTP process is indicating that it supports
   MLST, but implements no facts.  Only pathnames can be returned.  This
   would be a minimal MLST implementation, and useless for most
   practical purposes.  Where the factlist is present, the factnames
   included indicate the facts supported by the server.  Where the
   optional asterisk appears after a factname, that fact will be
   included in MLST format responses, until an &quot;OPTS MLST&quot; is given to
   alter the list of facts returned.  After that, subsequent FEAT
   commands will return the asterisk to show the facts selected by the
   most recent &quot;OPTS MLST&quot;.

</p>
<p>
   Note that there is no distinct FEAT output for MLSD.  The presence of
   the MLST feature indicates that both MLST and MLSD are supported.

   Aside from some features irrelevant here, this server indicates that
   it supports MLST including several, but not all, standard facts, all
   of which it will send by default.  It also supports two OS dependent
   facts, and one locally defined fact.  The latter three must be
   requested expressly by the client for this server to supply them.

   Again, in addition to some irrelevant features here, this server
   indicates that it supports MLST, four of the standard facts, one of
   which (&quot;unique&quot;) is not enabled by default, and several OS dependent
   facts, one of which is provided by the server by default.  This
   server actually supported more OS dependent facts.  Others were
   deleted for the purposes of this document to comply with document
   formatting restrictions.

   This server has wisely chosen not to implement any OS dependent
   facts.  At the time of writing this document, no such facts have been
   defined (using the mechanisms of section 10.1) so rational support
   for them would be difficult at best.  All but one of the facts
   supported by this server are enabled by default.

OPTS Parameters for MLST</h3>

<p>
   For the MLSx commands, the Client-FTP may specify a list of facts it
   wishes to be returned in all subsequent MLSx commands until another
   OPTS MLST command is sent.  The format is specified by:

</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
      mlst-opts     = "OPTS" SP "MLST"
                      [ SP 1*( factname ";" ) ]
</pre></div><p>


</p>
<p>
   By sending the &quot;OPTS MLST&quot; command, the client requests the server to
   include only the facts listed as arguments to the command in
   subsequent output from MLSx commands.  Facts not included in the
   &quot;OPTS MLST&quot; command MUST NOT be returned by the server.  Facts that
   are included should be returned for each entry returned from the MLSx
   command where they meaningfully apply.  Facts requested that are not
   supported, or that are inappropriate to the file or directory being
   listed should simply be omitted from the MLSx output.  This is not an
   error.  Note that where no factname arguments are present, the client
   is requesting that only the file names be returned.  In this case,
   and in any other case where no facts are included in the result, the
   space that separates the fact names and their values from the file
   name is still required.  That is, the first character of the output
   line will be a space, (or two characters will be spaces when the line
   is returned over the control connection) and the file name will start
   immediately thereafter.

</p>
<p>
   Clients should note that generating values for some facts can be
   possible, but very expensive, for some servers.  It is generally
   acceptable to retrieve any of the facts that the server offers as its
   default set before any &quot;OPTS MLST&quot; command has been given, however
   clients should use particular caution before requesting any facts not
   in that set.  That is, while other facts may be available from the
   server, clients should refrain from requesting such facts unless
   there is a particular operational requirement for that particular
   information, which ought be more significant than perhaps simply
   improving the information displayed to an end user.

</p>
<p>
   Note, there is no &quot;OPTS MLSD&quot; command, the fact names set with the
   &quot;OPTS MLST&quot; command apply to both MLST and MLSD commands.

</p>
<p>
   Servers are not required to accept &quot;OPTS MLST&quot; commands before
   authentication of the user-PI, but may choose to permit them.

</p>
<p>
   The facts named in the response are those that the server will now
   include in MLST (and MLSD) response, after the processing of the
   &quot;OPTS MLST&quot; command.  Any facts from the request not supported by the
   server will be omitted from this response message.  If no facts will
   be included, the list of facts will be empty.  Note that the list of
   facts returned will be the same as those marked by a trailing
   asterisk (&quot;*&quot;) in a subsequent FEAT command response.  There is no
   requirement that the order of the facts returned be the same as that
   in which they were requested, or that in which they will be listed in
   a FEAT command response, or that in which facts are returned in MLST
   responses.  The fixed string &quot;MLST OPTS&quot; in the response may be
   returned in any case, or mixture of cases.

   For the purposes of this example, features other than MLST have been
   deleted from the output to avoid clutter.  The example shows the
   initial default feature output for MLST.  The facts requested are
   then changed by the client.  The first change shows facts that are
   available from the server being selected.  Subsequent FEAT output
   shows the altered features as being returned.  The client then
   attempts to select some standard features that the server does not
   support.  This is not an error, however the server simply ignores the
   requests for unsupported features, as the FEAT output that follows
   shows.  Then, the client attempts to request a non-standard, and
   unsupported, feature.  The server ignores that, and selects only the
   supported features requested.  Lastly, the client sends a request
   containing a syntax error (spaces cannot appear in the factlist.)
   The server-FTP sends an error response and completely ignores the
   request, leaving the fact set selected as it had been previously.

<p>
   Note that in all cases, except the error response, the response lists
   the facts that have been selected.

   This example shows the effect of changing the facts requested upon

   preceding the pathname when no facts were selected, either
   deliberately, or because none of the facts requested were available.

Impact on Other FTP Commands</h3>

<p>
   Along with the introduction of MLST, traditional FTP commands must be
   extended to allow for the use of more than US-ASCII [1] or EBCDIC
   character sets.  In general, the support of MLST requires support for
   arbitrary character sets wherever file names and directory names are
   allowed.  This applies equally to both arguments given to the
   following commands and to the replies from them, as appropriate.

Character Sets and Internationalization</h3>

<p>
   FTP commands are protocol elements, and are always expressed in
   ASCII.  FTP responses are composed of the numeric code, which is a
   protocol element, and a message, which is often expected to convey
   information to the user.  It is not expected that users normally
   interact directly with the protocol elements, rather the user-FTP
   process constructs the commands, and interprets the results, in the
   manner best suited for the particular user.  Explanatory text in
   responses generally has no particular meaning to the protocol.  The
   numeric codes provide all necessary information.  Server-PIs are free
   to provide the text in any language that can be adequately
   represented in ASCII, or where an alternative language and
   representation has been negotiated (see <a class='info' href='#RFC2640'>[RFC2640]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Curtin, B., &ldquo;Internationalization of the File Transfer Protocol,&rdquo; July&nbsp;1999.</span><span>)</span></a>) in that language and
   representation.

</p>
<p>
   Pathnames are expected to be encoded in UTF-8 allowing essentially
   any character to be represented in a pathname.  Meaningful pathnames
   are defined by the server NVFS.

</p>
<p>
   No restrictions at all are placed upon the contents of files
   transferred using the FTP protocols.  Unless the &quot;media-type&quot; fact is
   provided in a MLSx response no advice is given here that would
   allow determining the content type.  That information is assumed to
   be obtained via other means.

            A User-FTP program MUST implement a "QUOTE" command that
            will pass an arbitrary character string to the server and
            display all resulting response messages to the user.

</p>
<p>
            To make the "QUOTE" command useful, a User-FTP SHOULD send
            transfer control commands to the server as the user enters
            them, rather than saving all the commands and sending them
            to the server only when a data transfer is started.

Non-standard Command Verbs</h3>

<p>
            FTP allows "experimental" commands, whose names begin with
            "X".  If these commands are subsequently adopted as
            standards, there may still be existing implementations using
            the "X" form.  At present, this is true for the directory
            commands:

FTP Replies</h3>

<p>
      Replies to File Transfer Protocol commands are devised to ensure
      the synchronization of requests and actions in the process of file
      transfer, and to guarantee that the user process always knows the
      state of the Server.  Every command MUST generate at least one
      reply, although there MAY be more than one; in the latter case,
      the multiple replies MUST be easily distinguished.  In addition,
      some commands occur in sequential groups, such as USER, PASS and
      ACCT, or RNFR and RNTO.  The replies show the existence of an
      intermediate state if all preceding commands have been successful.
      A failure at any point in the sequence necessitates the repetition
      of the entire sequence from the beginning.
</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
         The details of the command-reply sequence are made explicit in
         a set of state diagrams below.

</p>
</blockquote><p>

</p>
<p>
      An FTP reply consists of a three digit number (transmitted as
      three alphanumeric characters) followed by some text.  The number
      is intended for use by automata to determine what state to enter
      next; the text is intended for the human user.  It is intended
      that the three digits contain enough encoded information that the
      user-process (the User-PI) will not need to examine the text and
      MAY either discard it or pass it on to the user, as appropriate.
      In particular, the text MAY be server-dependent, so there are
      likely to be varying texts for each reply code.

</p>
<p>
      A reply is defined to contain the 3-digit code, followed by Space
      &lt;SP&gt;, followed by one line of text (where some maximum line length
      has been specified), and terminated by the Telnet end-of-line
      code.  There will be cases however, where the text is longer than
      a single line.  In these cases the complete text must be bracketed
      so the User-process knows when it MAY stop reading the reply (i.e.
      stop processing input on the control connection) and go do other
      things.  This requires a special format on the first line to
      indicate that more than one line is coming, and another on the
      last line to designate it as the last.  At least one of these must
      contain the appropriate reply code to indicate the state of the
      transaction.  To satisfy all factions, it was decided that both
      the first and last line codes should be the same.

</p>
<p>
         Thus the format for multi-line replies is that the first line
         will begin with the exact required reply code, followed
         immediately by a Hyphen, &quot;-&quot; (also known as Minus), followed by
         text.  The last line will begin with the same code, followed
         immediately by Space &lt;SP&gt;, optionally some text, and the Telnet
         end-of-line code.

</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>

            For example:
                                123-First line
                                Second line
                                  234 A line beginning with numbers
                                123 The last line
</pre></div><p>


</p>
<p>
         The user-process then simply needs to search for the second
         occurrence of the same reply code, followed by &lt;SP&gt; (Space), at
         the beginning of a line, and ignore all intermediary lines.  If
         an intermediary line begins with a 3-digit number, the Server
         must pad the front  to avoid confusion.

</p>
<p>
            This scheme allows standard system routines to be used for
            reply information (such as for the STAT reply), with
            &quot;artificial&quot; first and last lines tacked on.  In rare cases
            where these routines are able to generate three digits and a
            Space at the beginning of any line, the beginning of each
            text line should be offset by some neutral text, like Space.

</p>
<p>
         This scheme assumes that multi-line replies may not be nested.

</p>
<p>		 
            A Server-FTP MUST send only correctly formatted replies on
            the control connection.  Note that <a class='info' href='#RFC0959'>[RFC0959]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J. and J. Reynolds, &ldquo;File Transfer Protocol,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1985.</span><span>)</span></a> (unlike earlier
            versions of the FTP specification) contains no provision for a
            "spontaneous" reply message.

</p>
<p>
            A Server-FTP SHOULD use the reply codes defined here
            whenever they apply.  However, a server-FTP MAY use a
            different reply code when needed, as long as the general
            rules of this section are followed. When the implementor has
            a choice between a 4xx and 5xx reply code, a Server-FTP
            SHOULD send a 4xx (temporary failure) code when there is any
            reasonable possibility that a failed FTP will succeed a few
            hours later.

</p>
<p>
            A User-FTP SHOULD generally use only the highest-order digit
            of a 3-digit reply code for making a procedural decision, to
            prevent difficulties when a Server-FTP uses non-standard
            reply codes.

</p>
<p>
            A User-FTP MUST be able to handle multi-line replies.  If
            the implementation imposes a limit on the number of lines
            and if this limit is exceeded, the User-FTP MUST recover,
            e.g., by ignoring the excess lines until the end of the
            multi-line reply is reached.

</p>
<p>
            A User-FTP SHOULD NOT interpret a 421 reply code ("Service
            not available, closing control connection") specially, but
            SHOULD detect closing of the control connection by the
            server.

</p>
<p>
            A User-FTP SHOULD display to the user the full text of all
            error reply messages it receives.  It SHOULD have a
            "verbose" mode in which all commands it sends and the full
            text and reply codes it receives are displayed, for
            diagnosis of problems.

</p>
<p>
            The state machine in a User-FTP SHOULD be forgiving of
            missing and unexpected reply messages, in order to maintain
            command synchronization with the server.


</p>
<p>
      The three digits of the reply each have a special significance.
      This is intended to allow a range of very simple to very
      sophisticated responses by the user-process.  The first digit
      denotes whether the response is good, bad or incomplete.
      (Referring to the state diagram), an unsophisticated user-process
      will be able to determine its next action (proceed as planned,
      redo, retrench, etc.) by simply examining this first digit.  A
      user-process that wants to know approximately what kind of error
      occurred (e.g. file system error, command syntax error) MAY
      examine the second digit, reserving the third digit for the finest
      gradation of information (e.g., RNTO command without a preceding
      RNFR).

</p>
<p>
</p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
      There are five values for the first digit of the reply code:

         1yz   Positive Preliminary reply

            The requested action is being initiated; expect another
            reply before proceeding with a new command.  (The
            user-process sending another command before the
            completion reply would be in violation of protocol; but
            server-FTP processes should queue any commands that
            arrive while a preceding command is in progress.)  This
            type of reply can be used to indicate that the command
            was accepted and the user-process may now pay attention
            to the data connections, for implementations where
            simultaneous monitoring is difficult.  The server-FTP
            process MAY send at most, one 1yz reply per command.

         2yz   Positive Completion reply

             The requested action has been successfully completed.  A
             new request may be initiated.

         3yz   Positive Intermediate reply

            The command has been accepted, but the requested action
            is being held in abeyance, pending receipt of further
            information.  The user should send another command
            specifying this information.  This reply is used in
            command sequence groups.

         4yz   Transient Negative Completion reply

            The command was not accepted and the requested action did
            not take place, but the error condition is temporary and
            the action MAY be requested again.  The user should
            return to the beginning of the command sequence, if any.
            It is difficult to assign a meaning to "transient",
            particularly when two distinct sites (Server- and
            User-processes) have to agree on the interpretation.
            Each reply in the 4yz category might have a slightly
            different time value, but the intent is that the
            user-process is encouraged to try again.  A rule of thumb
            in determining if a reply fits into the 4yz or the 5yz
            (Permanent Negative) category is that replies are 4yz if
            the commands can be repeated without any change in
            command form or in properties of the User or Server
            (e.g., the command is spelled the same with the same
            arguments used; the user does not change his file access
            or user name; the server does not put up a new
            implementation.)

         5yz   Permanent Negative Completion reply

            The command was not accepted and the requested action did
            not take place.  The User-process is discouraged from
            repeating the exact request (in the same sequence).  Even
            some "permanent" error conditions can be corrected, so
            the human user may want to direct his User-process to
            reinitiate the command sequence by direct action at some
            point in the future (e.g., after the spelling has been
            changed, or the user has altered his directory status.)
</pre></div><p>


</p>
<p>
         The following function groupings are encoded in the second
         digit:

</p>
<p>
</p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
         x0z   Syntax - These replies refer to syntax errors,
               syntactically correct commands that don't fit any
               functional category, unimplemented or superfluous
               commands.

         x1z   Information -  These are replies to requests for
               information, such as status or help.

         x2z   Connections - Replies referring to the control and
               data connections.

         x3z   Authentication and accounting - Replies for the login
               process and accounting procedures.

         x4z   Unspecified as yet.

         x5z   File system - These replies indicate the status of the
               Server file system vis-a-vis the requested transfer or
               other file system action.
</pre></div><p>


</p>
<p>
         The third digit gives a finer gradation of meaning in each of
         the function categories, specified by the second digit.  The
         list of replies below will illustrate this.  Note that the text
         associated with each reply is recommended, rather than
         mandatory, and MAY even change according to the command with
         which it is associated.  The reply codes, on the other hand,
         MUST strictly follow the specifications in the last section;
         that is, Server implementations SHOULD NOT invent new codes for
         situations that are only slightly different from the ones
         described here, but rather SHOULD adapt codes already defined.

            has no relevance to that computer system, for example ALLO
            at a TOPS20 site, a Positive Completion reply is still
            desired so that the simple User-process knows it can proceed
            with its course of action.  A 202 reply is used in this case
            with, for example, the reply text:  &quot;No storage allocation
            necessary.&quot;  If, on the other hand, the command requests a
            non-site-specific action and is unimplemented, the response
            is 502.  A refinement of that is the 504 reply for a command

Protected Replies from RFC 2228</h3>

<p>
</p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
         6yz   Protected reply

            There are three reply codes of this type.  The first, reply
            code 631 indicates an integrity protected reply.  The
            second, reply code 632, indicates a confidentiality and
            integrity protected reply.  the third, reply code 633,
            indicates a confidentiality protected reply.

            The text part of a 631 reply is a Telnet string consisting
            of a base 64 encoded "safe" message produced by a security
            mechanism specific message integrity procedure.  The text
            part of a 632 reply is a Telnet string consisting of a base
            64 encoded "private" message produced by a security
            mechanism specific message confidentiality and integrity
            procedure.  The text part of a 633 reply is a Telnet string
            consisting of a base 64 encoded "confidential" message
            produced by a security mechanism specific message
            confidentiality procedure.

            The client will decode and verify the encoded reply.  How
            failures decoding or verifying replies are handled is
            implementation-specific.  An end-of-line code need not be
            included, but if one is included, it must be a Telnet end-
            of-line code, not a local end-of-line code.

            A protected reply may only be sent if a security data
            exchange has succeeded.

            The 63z reply may be a multiline reply.  In this case, the
            plaintext reply must be broken up into a number of
            fragments.  Each fragment must be protected, then base 64
            encoded in order into a separate line of the multiline
            reply.  There need not be any correspondence between the
            line breaks in the plaintext reply and the encoded reply.
            Telnet end-of-line codes must appear in the plaintext of the
            encoded reply, except for the final end-of-line code, which
            is optional.

            The multiline reply must be formatted more strictly than the
            continuation specification in RFC0959.  In particular, each
            line before the last must be formed by the reply code,
            followed immediately by a hyphen, followed by a base 64
            encoded fragment of the reply.

            For example, if the plaintext reply is

               123-First line

Connections</h3>

<p>
      The server protocol interpreter shall &quot;listen&quot; on Port L.  The
      user or user protocol interpreter shall initiate the full-duplex
      control connection.  Server- and user- processes should follow the
      conventions of the Telnet protocol as specified in the
      ARPA-Internet Protocol Handbook <a class='info' href='#IPTW'>[IPTW]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Feinler, E., &ldquo;Internet Protocol Transition Workbook,&rdquo; March&nbsp;1982.</span><span>)</span></a>.  Servers are under no
      obligation to provide for editing of command lines and MAY require
      that it be done in the user host.  The control connection shall be
      closed by the server at the user's request after all transfers and
      replies are completed.

</p>
<p>
      The user-DTP MUST &quot;listen&quot; on the specified data port; this may be
      the default user port (U) or a port specified in the PORT command.
      The server shall initiate the data connection from his own default
      data port (L-1) using the specified user data port.  The direction
      of the transfer will be determined by the FTP
      service command.

</p>
<p>
            On a multihomed server host, the default data transfer port
            (L-1) MUST be associated with the same local IP address as
            the corresponding control connection to port L.

</p>
<p>
      Note that all FTP implementation MUST support data transfer using
      the default port, and that only the USER-PI MAY initiate the use
      of non-default ports.

</p>
<p>
      When data is to be transferred between two servers, A and B (refer
      to Figure 2), the user-PI, C, sets up control connections with
      both server-PI's.  One of the servers, say A, is then sent a PASV
      command telling him to &quot;listen&quot; on his data port rather than
      initiate a connection when he receives a transfer service command.
      When the user-PI receives an acknowledgment to the PASV command,
      which includes the identity of the host and port being listened
      on, the user-PI then sends A's port, a, to B in a PORT command; a
      reply is returned.  The user-PI may then send the corresponding
      service commands to A and B.  Server B initiates the connection
      and the transfer proceeds.  The command-reply sequence is listed
      below where the messages are vertically synchronous but
      horizontally asynchronous:

</p>
<p>
      The data connection shall be closed by the server under the
      conditions described in <a class='info' href='#sec-3.2'>Section&nbsp;3.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Establishing Data Connections</span><span>)</span></a>.  If the data connection is to be closed following a
      data transfer where closing the connection is not required to
      indicate the end-of-file, the server must do so immediately.
      Waiting until after a new transfer command is not permitted
      because the user-process will have already tested the data
      connection to see if it needs to do a &quot;listen&quot;; (remember that the
      user must &quot;listen&quot; on a closed data port BEFORE sending the
      transfer request).  To prevent a race condition here, the server
      sends a reply (226) after closing the data connection (or if the
      connection is left open, a &quot;file transfer completed&quot; reply (250)
      and the user-PI should wait for one of these replies before
      issuing a new transfer command).

</p>
<p>
      Any time either the user or server see that the connection is
      being closed by the other side, it should promptly read any
      remaining data queued on the connection and issue the close on its
      own side.

</p>
<p>
            A Server-FTP process SHOULD have an idle timeout, which will
            terminate the process and close the control connection if
            the server is inactive (i.e., no command or data transfer in
            progress) for a long period of time.  The idle timeout time
            SHOULD be configurable, and the default should be at least 5
            minutes.

</p>
<p>
            A client FTP process ("User-PI" in <a class='info' href='#RFC0959'>[RFC0959]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J. and J. Reynolds, &ldquo;File Transfer Protocol,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1985.</span><span>)</span></a>) will need
            timeouts on responses only if it is invoked from a program.

</p>
<p>
            A user-FTP MUST NOT send any Telnet controls other than
            SYNCH and IP on an FTP control connection. In particular, it
            MUST NOT attempt to negotiate Telnet options on the control
            connection.  However, a server-FTP MUST be capable of
            accepting and refusing Telnet negotiations (i.e., sending
            DONT/WONT).

      The commands begin with a command code followed by an argument
      field.  The command codes are four or fewer alphabetic characters.
      Upper and lower case alphabetic characters are to be treated
      identically.  Thus, any of the following MAY represent the
      retrieve command:

</p>
<p>


</p>
<p>
</p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
                  RETR    Retr    retr    ReTr    rETr</pre></div><p>



</p>
<p>
      This also applies to any symbols representing parameter values,
      such as "A" or "a" for ASCII TYPE.  The command codes and the argument
      fields are separated by one or more spaces.

</p>
<p>
      The argument field consists of a variable length character string
      ending with the character sequence &lt;CRLF&gt; (Carriage Return, Line
      Feed) for NVT-ASCII representation; for other negotiated languages
      a different end of line character might be used.  It should be
      noted that the server is to take no action until the end of line
      code is received.

</p>
<p>
      The syntax is specified below in NVT-ASCII.  All characters in the
      argument field are ASCII characters including any ASCII
      represented decimal integers.  Square brackets denote an optional
      argument field.  If the option is not taken, the appropriate
      default is implied.

Sequencing of Commands and Replies</h3>

<p>
      The communication between the user and server is intended to be an
      alternating dialogue.  As such, the user issues an FTP command and
      the server responds with a prompt primary reply.  The user should
      wait for this initial primary success or failure response before
      sending further commands.

</p>
<p>
      Certain commands require a second reply for which the user should
      also wait.  These replies may, for example, report on the progress
      or completion of file transfer or the closing of the data
      connection.  They are secondary replies to file transfer commands.

</p>
<p>
      One important group of informational replies is the connection
      greetings.  Under normal circumstances, a server will send a 220
      reply, &quot;awaiting input&quot;, when the connection is completed.  The
      user should wait for this greeting message before sending any
      commands.  If the server is unable to accept input right away, a
      120 &quot;expected delay&quot; reply should be sent immediately and a 220
      reply when ready.  The user will then know not to hang up if there
      is a delay.

</p>
<p>
</p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Spontaneous Replies</dt>
<dd>
       
       <br />

         Sometimes &quot;the system&quot; spontaneously has a message to be sent
         to a user (usually all users).  For example, &quot;System going down
         in 15 minutes&quot;.  There is no provision in FTP for such
         spontaneous information to be sent from the server to the user.
         It is recommended that such information be queued in the
         server-PI and delivered to the user-PI in the next reply
         (possibly making it a multi-line reply).

</dd>
</dl></blockquote><p>

</p>
<p>
      The table below lists alternative success and failure replies for
      each command.  These MUST be strictly adhered to; a server MAY
      substitute text in the replies, but the meaning and action implied
      by the code numbers and by the specific command reply sequence
      cannot be altered.

</p>
<p>
</p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Command-Reply Sequences</dt>
<dd>
       
       <br />

         In this section, the command-reply sequence is presented.  Each
         command is listed with its possible replies; command groups are
         listed together.  Preliminary replies are listed first (with
         their succeeding replies indented and under them), then
         positive and negative completion, and finally intermediary
         replies with the remaining commands from the sequence
         following.  This listing forms the basis for the state
         diagrams, which will be presented separately.

State Diagrams</h3>

<p>
   Here we present state diagrams for a very simple minded FTP
   implementation.  Only the first digit of the reply codes is used.
   There is one state diagram for each group of FTP commands or command
   sequences.

</p>
<p>
   The command groupings were determined by constructing a model for
   each command then collecting together the commands with structurally
   identical models.

</p>
<p>
   For each command or command sequence there are three possible
   outcomes: success (S), failure (F), and error (E).  In the state
   diagrams below we use the symbol B for &quot;begin&quot;, and the symbol W for
   &quot;wait for reply&quot;.

</p>
<p>
   We first present the diagram that represents the largest group of FTP
   commands:

</p>
<p>
</p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>

                               1,3    +---+
                          -----------&gt;| E |
                         |            +---+
                         |
      +---+    cmd    +---+    2      +---+
      | B |----------&gt;| W |----------&gt;| S |
      +---+           +---+           +---+
                         |
                         |     4,5    +---+
                          -----------&gt;| F |
                                      +---+
</pre></div><p>

      

</p>
<p>
      This diagram models the commands:

</p>
<p>
</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
         ABOR, ALLO, DELE, CWD, CDUP, SMNT, HELP, MODE, NOOP, PASV,
         QUIT, SITE, PORT, SYST, STAT, RMD, MKD, PWD, STRU, and TYPE.

</p>
</blockquote><p>

</p>
<p>


</p>
<p>
   The other large group of commands is represented by a very similar
   diagram:

</p>
<p>
</p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>

                               3      +---+
                          -----------&gt;| E |
                         |            +---+
                         |
      +---+    cmd    +---+    2      +---+
      | B |----------&gt;| W |----------&gt;| S |
      +---+       ---&gt;+---+           +---+
                 |     | |
                 |     | |     4,5    +---+
                 |  1  |  -----------&gt;| F |
                  -----               +---+
</pre></div><p>

      

</p>
<p>
      This diagram models the commands:

</p>
<p>
</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
         APPE, LIST, NLST, REIN, RETR, STOR, and STOU.

</p>
</blockquote><p>

</p>
<p>
   Note that this second model could also be used to represent the first
   group of commands, the only difference being that in the first group
   the 100 series replies are unexpected and therefore treated as error,
   while the second group expects (some MAY require) 100 series replies.
   Remember that at most, one 100 series reply is allowed per command.

</p>
<p>
   The remaining diagrams model command sequences, perhaps the simplest
   of these is the rename sequence:

</p>
<p>
</p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>

      +---+   RNFR    +---+    1,2    +---+
      | B |----------&gt;| W |----------&gt;| E |

                       | |        |
                3      | | 4,5    |
         --------------  ------   |
        |                      |  |   +---+
        |               -------------&gt;| S |
        |              |   1,3 |  |   +---+
        |             2|  --------

      |   |----------&gt;| W |----------&gt;| F |
      +---+           +---+           +---+
</pre></div><p>

      

</p>
<p>


</p>
<p>
   The next diagram is a simple model of the Restart command:

</p>
<p>
</p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>

      +---+   REST    +---+    1,2    +---+
      | B |----------&gt;| W |----------&gt;| E |
      +---+           +---+        --&gt;+---+
                       | |        |
                3      | | 4,5    |
         --------------  ------   |
        |                      |  |   +---+
        |               -------------&gt;| S |
        |              |   3   |  |   +---+
        |             2|  --------
        |              | |     |
        V              | |     |
      +---+   cmd     +---+ 4,5 -----&gt;+---+
      |   |----------&gt;| W |----------&gt;| F |
      +---+        --&gt;+---+           +---+
                  |      |
                  |  1   |
                   ------
</pre></div><p>
  

</p>
<p>
         Where &quot;cmd&quot; is APPE, STOR, or RETR.

</p>
<p>
   We note that the above three models are similar.  The Restart differs
   from the Rename two only in the treatment of 100 series replies at
   the second stage, while the second group expects (some MAY require)
   100 series replies.  Remember that at most, one 100 series reply is
   allowed per command.

</p>
<p>


</p>
<p>
   The most complicated diagram is for the Login sequence:

</p>
<p>
</p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>

                            1

   Finally, we present a generalized diagram that could be used to model
   the command and reply interchange:

<a name="rfc.section.10.3"></a><h3>10.3.&nbsp;
The Bounce Attack</h3>

<p>
   The version of FTP specified in the standard <a class='info' href='#RFC0959'>[RFC0959]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J. and J. Reynolds, &ldquo;File Transfer Protocol,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1985.</span><span>)</span></a> provides a method
   for attacking well known network servers, while making the
   perpetrators difficult to track down.  The attack involves sending an
   FTP &quot;PORT&quot; command to an FTP server containing the network address
   and the port number of the machine and service being attacked.  At
   this point, the original client can instruct the FTP server to send a
   file to the service being attacked.  Such a file would contain
   commands relevant to the service being attacked (SMTP, NNTP, etc.).
   Instructing a third party to connect to the service, rather than
   connecting directly, makes tracking down the perpetrator difficult
   and can circumvent network-address-based access restrictions.

</p>
<p>
   As an example, a client uploads a file containing SMTP commands to an
   FTP server.  Then, using an appropriate PORT command, the client
   instructs the server to open a connection to a third machine's SMTP
   port.  Finally, the client instructs the server to transfer the
   uploaded file containing SMTP commands to the third machine.  This
   may allow the client to forge mail on the third machine without
   making a direct connection.  This makes it difficult to track
   attackers.

Protecting Against the Bounce Attack</h3>

<p>
   The original FTP specification <a class='info' href='#RFC0959'>[RFC0959]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J. and J. Reynolds, &ldquo;File Transfer Protocol,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1985.</span><span>)</span></a> assumes that data connections
   will be made using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) <a class='info' href='#RFC0793'>[RFC0793]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J., &ldquo;Transmission Control Protocol,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1981.</span><span>)</span></a>.
   TCP port numbers in the range 0 - 1023 are reserved for well known
   services such as mail, network news and FTP control connections
   (See IANA "Port Numbers" Registry at http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers ).  The FTP specification makes no restrictions on the TCP port
   number used for the data connection.  Therefore, using proxy FTP,
   clients have the ability to tell the server to attack a well known
   service on any machine.

</p>
<p>
   To avoid such bounce attacks, it is suggested that servers not open
   data connections to TCP ports less than 1024.  If a server receives a
   PORT command containing a TCP port number less than 1024, the
   suggested response is 504 (defined as &quot;Command not implemented for
   that parameter&quot; by <a class='info' href='#RFC0959'>[RFC0959]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J. and J. Reynolds, &ldquo;File Transfer Protocol,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1985.</span><span>)</span></a>).  Note that this still leaves non-well
   known servers (those running on ports greater than 1023) vulnerable
   to bounce attacks.

   that would allow data connections to be made using a transport
   protocol other than TCP.  Similar precautions should be taken to
   protect well known services when using these protocols.

</p>
<p>
   Also note that the bounce attack generally requires that a
   perpetrator be able to upload a file to an FTP server and later
   download it to the service being attacked.  Using proper file
   protections will prevent this behavior.  However, attackers can also
   attack services by sending random data from a remote FTP server which
   may cause problems for some services.

</p>
<p>
   Disabling the PORT command is also an option for protecting against
   the bounce attack.  Most file transfers can be made using only the
   PASV command [Bel94].  The disadvantage of disabling the PORT command
   is that one loses the ability to use proxy FTP, but proxy FTP may not
   be necessary in a particular environment.

<a name="rfc.section.10.4"></a><h3>10.4.&nbsp;
Restricted Access</h3>

<p>
   For some FTP servers, it is desirable to restrict access based on
   network address.  For example, a server might want to restrict access
   to certain files from certain places (e.g., a certain file should not
   be transferred out of an organization).  In such a situation, the
   server should confirm that the network address of the remote hosts on
   both the control connection and the data connection are within the
   organization before sending a restricted file.  By checking both
   connections, a server is protected against the case when the control
   connection is established with a trusted host and the data connection
   is not.  Likewise, the client should verify the IP address of the
   remote host after accepting a connection on a port opened in listen
   mode to verify that the connection was made by the expected server.

</p>
<p>
   Note that restricting access based on network address leaves the FTP
   server vulnerable to &quot;spoof&quot; attacks.  In a spoof attack, for
   example, an attacking machine could assume the host address of
   another machine inside an organization and download files that are
   not accessible from outside the organization.  Whenever possible,
   secure authentication mechanisms should be used, such as those
   outlined in <a class='info' href='#RFC2228'>[RFC2228]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Horowitz, M., &ldquo;FTP Security Extensions,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1997.</span><span>)</span></a>.

<a name="rfc.section.10.5"></a><h3>10.5.&nbsp;
Protecting Passwords Against Brute Force Attacks</h3>

<p>
   To minimize the risk of brute force password guessing through the FTP
   server, it is suggested that servers limit the number of attempts
   that can be made at sending a correct password.  After a small number
   of attempts (3-5), the server should close the control connection
   with the client.  Before closing the control connection the server
   must send a return code of 421 (&quot;Service not available, closing
   control connection.&quot; <a class='info' href='#RFC0959'>[RFC0959]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J. and J. Reynolds, &ldquo;File Transfer Protocol,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1985.</span><span>)</span></a>) to the client.  In addition, it is
   suggested that the server impose a 5 second delay before replying to
   an invalid &quot;PASS&quot; command to diminish the efficiency of a brute force
   attack.  If available, mechanisms already provided by the target
   operating system should be used to implement the above suggestions.

</p>
<p>
   An intruder can subvert the above mechanisms by establishing
   multiple, parallel control connections to a server.  To combat the
   use of multiple concurrent connections, the server could either limit
   the total number of control connections possible or attempt to detect
   suspicious activity across sessions and refuse further connections
   from the site.  However, both of these mechanisms open the door to
   &quot;denial of service&quot; attacks, in which an attacker purposely initiates
   the attack to disable access by a valid user.

Protecting Usernames</h3>

   the username is rejected.  If the username is valid and a password is
   required FTP returns a 331 response instead.  In order to prevent a
   malicious client from determining valid usernames on a server, it is
   suggested that a server always return 331 to the USER command and
   then reject the combination of username and password for an invalid
   username.

Port Stealing</h3>

<p>
   Many operating systems assign dynamic port numbers in increasing
   order.  By making a legitimate transfer, an attacker can observe the
   current port number allocated by the server and &quot;guess&quot; the next one
   that will be used.  The attacker can make a connection to this port,
   thus denying another legitimate client the ability to make a
   transfer.  Alternatively, the attacker can steal a file meant for a
   legitimate user.  In addition, an attacker can insert a forged file
   into a data stream thought to come from an authenticated client.
   This problem can be mitigated by making FTP clients and servers use
   random local port numbers for data connections, either by requesting
   random ports from the operating system or using system dependent
   mechanisms.

Software-Base Security Problems</h3>

<p>
   The emphasis in this document is on protocol-related security issues.
   There are a number of documented FTP security-related problems that
   are due to poor implementation as well.  Although the details of
   these types of problems are beyond the scope of this document, it
   should be pointed out that the following FTP features have been abused
   in the past and should be treated with great care by future
   implementers:

</p>
<p>Anonymous FTP
</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
      Anonymous FTP refers to the ability of a client to connect to an
      FTP server with minimal authentication and gain access to public
      files.  Security problems arise when such a user can read all
      files on the system or can create files. [CERT92:09] [CERT93:06]

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Remote Command Execution
</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
      An optional FTP extension, &quot;SITE EXEC&quot;, allows clients to execute
      arbitrary commands on the server.  This feature should obviously
      be implemented with great care.  There are several documented
      cases of the FTP &quot;SITE EXEC&quot; command being used to subvert server
      security [CERT94:08] [CERT95:16]

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Debug Code
</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
      Several previous security compromises related to FTP can be
      attributed to software that was installed with debugging features
      enabled [CERT88:01].

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
   This document recommends that implementors of FTP servers with these
   capabilities review all of the CERT advisories for attacks on these
   or similar mechanisms before releasing their software.

Server Capabilities Exposed by FEAT</h3>

<p>
   No significant new security issues, not already present in the FTP
   protocol, are believed to have been created by this extension.
   However, FEAT does provide a mechanism by which users can
   determine the capabilities of an FTP server, and from which
   additional information may be able to be deduced.  While the same
   basic information could be obtained by probing the server for the
   various commands, if the FEAT command were not provided, that method
   may reveal an attacker by logging the attempts to access various
   extension commands.  This possibility is not considered a serious
   enough threat to be worthy of any remedial action.

</p>
<p>
   The security of any additional features that might be reported by the
   FEAT command, and manipulated by the OPTS command, should be
   addressed where those features are defined.

<a name="rfc.section.10.10"></a><h3>10.10.&nbsp;
SIZE and MLSx</h3>

<p>
   Implementing the SIZE command, and perhaps some of the facts of the
   MLSx commands, may impose a considerable load on the server, which
   could lead to denial of service attacks.  Servers have, however,
   implemented this for many years, without significant reported
   difficulties.

</p>
<p>
   The server-FTP should take care not to reveal sensitive information
   about files to unauthorised parties.  In particular, some underlying
   filesystems provide a file identifier that, if known, can allow many
   of the filesystem protection mechanisms to be by-passed.  That
   identifier would not be a suitable choice to use as the basis of the
   value of the unique fact.

</p>
<p>
   The FEAT and OPTS commands may be issued before the FTP
   authentication has occurred <a class='info' href='#RFC2389'>[RFC2389]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hethmon, P. and R. Elz, &ldquo;Feature negotiation mechanism for the File Transfer Protocol,&rdquo; August&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a>.  This allows unauthenticated clients
   to determine which of the features defined here are supported, and to
   negotiate the fact list for MLSx output.  No actual MLSx commands may
   be issued however, and no problems with permitting the selection of
   the format prior to authentication are foreseen.

Page Structure</h3>

<p>
   The need for FTP to support page structure derives principally from
   the  need to support efficient transmission of files between TOPS-20
   systems, particularly the files used by NLS.

</p>
<p>
   The file system of TOPS-20 is based on the concept of pages.  The
   operating system is most efficient at manipulating files as pages.
   The operating system provides an interface to the file system so that
   many applications view files as sequential streams of characters.
   However, a few applications use the underlying page structures
   directly, and some of these create holey files.

</p>
<p>
   A TOPS-20 disk file consists of four things: a pathname, a page
   table, a (possibly empty) set of pages, and a set of attributes.

</p>
<p>
   The pathname is specified in the RETR or STOR command.  It includes
   the directory name, file name, file name extension, and generation
   number.

</p>
<p>
   The page table contains up to 2**18 entries.  Each entry may be
   EMPTY, or may point to a page.  If it is not empty, there are also
   some page-specific access bits; not all pages of a file need have the
   same access protection.

</p>
<p>
      A page is a contiguous set of 512 words of 36 bits each.

</p>
<p>
   The attributes of the file, in the File Descriptor Block (FDB),
   contain such things as creation time, write time, read time, writer's
   byte-size, end-of-file pointer, count of reads and writes, backup
   system tape numbers, etc.

</p>
<p>
   Note that there is NO requirement that entries in the page table be
   contiguous.  There may be empty page table slots between occupied
   ones.  Also, the end of file pointer is simply a number.  There is no
   requirement that it in fact point at the &quot;last&quot; datum in the file.
   Ordinary sequential I/O calls in TOPS-20 will cause the end of file
   pointer to be left after the last datum written, but other operations
   may cause it not to be so, if a particular programming system so
   requires.

</p>
<p>
   In fact, in both of these special cases, &quot;holey&quot; files and
   end-of-file pointers NOT at the end of the file, occur with NLS data
   files.

</p>
<p>


</p>
<p>
   The TOPS-20 paged files can be sent with the FTP transfer parameters:
   TYPE L 36, STRU P, and MODE S (in fact, any mode could be used).

</p>
<p>
   Each page of information has a header.  Each header field, which is a
   logical byte, is a TOPS-20 word, since the TYPE is L 36.

</p>
<p>
   The header fields are:

</p>
<p>
      Word 0: Header Length.

</p>
<p>
         The header length is 5.

</p>
<p>
      Word 1: Page Index.

</p>
<p>
         If the data is a disk file page, this is the number of that
         page in the file's page map.  Empty pages (holes) in the file
         are simply not sent.  Note that a hole is NOT the same as a
         page of zeros.

</p>
<p>
      Word 2: Data Length.

</p>
<p>
         The number of data words in this page, following the header.
         Thus, the total length of the transmission unit is the Header
         Length plus the Data Length.

</p>
<p>
      Word 3: Page Type.

</p>
<p>
         A code for what type of chunk this is.  A data page is type 3,
         the FDB page is type 2.

</p>
<p>
      Word 4: Page Access Control.

</p>
<p>
         The access bits associated with the page in the file's page
         map.  (This full word quantity is put into AC2 of an SPACS by
         the program reading from net to disk.)

</p>
<p>
   After the header are Data Length data words.  Data Length is
   currently either 512 for a data page or 31 for an FDB.  Trailing
   zeros in a disk file page may be discarded, making Data Length less
   than 512 in that case.

Directory Commands</h3>

<p>
   Since UNIX has a tree-like directory structure in which directories
   are as easy to manipulate as ordinary files, it is useful to expand
   the FTP servers on these machines to include commands which deal with
   the creation of directories.  Since there are other hosts on the
   ARPA-Internet which have tree-like directories (including TOPS-20 and
   Multics), these commands are as general as possible.

</p>
<p>
      Four directory commands have been added to FTP:

</p>
<p>
         MKD pathname

</p>
<p>
            Make a directory with the name &quot;pathname&quot;.

</p>
<p>
         RMD pathname

</p>
<p>
            Remove the directory with the name &quot;pathname&quot;.

</p>
<p>
         PWD

</p>
<p>
            Print the current working directory name.

</p>
<p>
         CDUP

</p>
<p>
            Change to the parent of the current working directory.

</p>
<p>
   The  &quot;pathname&quot;  argument should be created (removed) as a
   subdirectory of the current working directory, unless the &quot;pathname&quot;
   string contains sufficient information to specify otherwise to the
   server, e.g., &quot;pathname&quot; is an absolute pathname (in UNIX and
   Multics), or pathname is something like &quot;&lt;abso.lute.path&gt;&quot; to
   TOPS-20.

</p>
<p>
   REPLY CODES

</p>
<p>
      The CDUP command is a special case of CWD, and is included to
      simplify the implementation of programs for transferring directory
      trees between operating systems having different syntaxes for
      naming the parent directory.  The reply codes for CDUP be
      identical to the reply codes of CWD.

</p>
<p>
      The reply codes for RMD be identical to the reply codes for its
      file analogue, DELE.

</p>
<p>
      The reply codes for MKD, however, are a bit more complicated.  A
      freshly created directory will probably be the object of a future

</p>
<p>


</p>
<p>
      CWD command.  Unfortunately, the argument to MKD may not always be
      a suitable argument for CWD.  This is the case, for example, when
      a TOPS-20 subdirectory is created by giving just the subdirectory
      name.  That is, with a TOPS-20 server FTP, the command sequence

</p>
<p>
         MKD MYDIR
         CWD MYDIR

</p>
<p>
      will fail.  The new directory may only be referred to by its
      &quot;absolute&quot; name; e.g., if the MKD command above were issued while
      connected to the directory &lt;DFRANKLIN&gt;, the new subdirectory
      could only be referred to by the name &lt;DFRANKLIN.MYDIR&gt;.

</p>
<p>
      Even on UNIX and Multics, however, the argument given to MKD may
      not be suitable.  If it is a &quot;relative&quot; pathname (i.e., a pathname
      which is interpreted relative to the current directory), the user
      would need to be in the same current directory in order to reach
      the subdirectory.  Depending on the application, this may be
      inconvenient.  It is not very robust in any case.

</p>
<p>
      To solve these problems, upon successful completion of an MKD
      command, the server should return a line of the form:

</p>
<p>
         257&lt;space&gt;&quot;&lt;directory-name&gt;&quot;&lt;space&gt;&lt;commentary&gt;

</p>
<p>
      That is, the server will tell the user what string to use when
      referring to the created  directory.  The directory name can
      contain any character; embedded double-quotes should be escaped by
      double-quotes (the &quot;quote-doubling&quot; convention).

</p>
<p>
      For example, a user connects to the directory /usr/dm, and creates
      a subdirectory, named pathname:

</p>
<p>
</p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
         CWD /usr/dm
         200 directory changed to /usr/dm
         MKD pathname
         257 "/usr/dm/pathname" directory created
</pre></div><p>
		 

</p>
<p>
      An example with an embedded double quote:

</p>
<p>
</p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
         MKD foo"bar
         257 "/usr/dm/foo""bar" directory created
         CWD /usr/dm/foo"bar
         200 directory changed to /usr/dm/foo"bar
</pre></div><p>


</p>
<p>


</p>
<p>
      The prior existence of a subdirectory with the same name is an
      error, and the server must return an &quot;access denied&quot; error reply
      in that case.

</p>
<p>
</p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
         CWD /usr/dm
         200 directory changed to /usr/dm
         MKD pathname
         521-"/usr/dm/pathname" directory already exists;
         521 taking no action.
</pre></div><p>


</p>
<p>
      The failure replies for MKD are analogous to its file  creating
      cousin, STOR.  Also, an &quot;access denied&quot; return is given if a file
      name with the same name as the subdirectory will conflict with the
      creation of the subdirectory (this is a problem on UNIX, but
      shouldn't be one on TOPS-20).

</p>
<p>
      Essentially because the PWD command returns the same type of
      information as the successful MKD command, the successful PWD
      command uses the 257 reply code as well.

</p>
<p>
   SUBTLETIES

</p>
<p>
      Because these commands will be most useful in transferring
      subtrees from one machine to another, carefully observe that the
      argument to MKD is to be interpreted as a sub-directory of  the
      current working directory, unless it contains enough information
      for the destination host to tell otherwise.  A hypothetical
      example of its use in the TOPS-20 world:

</p>
<p>
</p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
         CWD &lt;some.where&gt;
         200 Working directory changed
         MKD overrainbow
         257 "&lt;some.where.overrainbow&gt;" directory created
         CWD overrainbow
         431 No such directory
         CWD &lt;some.where.overrainbow&gt;
         200 Working directory changed
</pre></div><p>


</p>
<p>
</p>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
         CWD &lt;some.where&gt;
         200 Working directory changed to &lt;some.where&gt;
         MKD &lt;unambiguous&gt;
         257 "&lt;unambiguous&gt;" directory created
         CWD &lt;unambiguous&gt;
</pre></div><p>


</p>
<p>
      Note that the first example results in a subdirectory of the
      connected directory.  In contrast, the argument in the second
      example contains enough information for TOPS-20 to tell that  the

</p>
<p>


</p>
<p>
      &lt;unambiguous&gt; directory is a top-level directory.  Note also that
      in the first example the user &quot;violated&quot; the protocol by
      attempting to access the freshly created directory with a name
      other than the one returned by TOPS-20.  Problems could have
      resulted in this case had there been an &lt;overrainbow&gt; directory;
      this is an ambiguity inherent in some TOPS-20 implementations.
      Similar considerations apply to the RMD command.  The point is
      this: except where to do so would violate a host's conventions for
      denoting relative versus absolute pathnames, the host should treat
      the operands of the MKD and RMD commands as subdirectories.  The
      257 reply to the MKD command must always contain the absolute
      pathname of the created directory.

</p>
<p>Update BNF to ABNF.
</p>
<p>Should we organize commands in a standard format (subsections?) like EPRT/EPSV (<a class='info' href='#sec-4.1.2.1'>Section&nbsp;4.1.2.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Extensions for IPv6 and NATs: Extended Port (EPRT) and Extended Passive Mode (EPSV)</span><span>)</span></a>), with separated ABNF?
</p>
<p>Should we update IP Address:Port description to ABNF? (We could borrow from HOST). Or standardize on one example: h1,h2,h3,h4,p1,p2 or A1,A2,A3,A4,a1,a2?
</p>
<p>Should we move the whole sentence that is <a class='info' href='#sec-8'>Section&nbsp;8<span> (</span><span class='info'>Connection Establishment</span><span>)</span></a> into <a class='info' href='#sec-3.2'>Section&nbsp;3.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Establishing Data Connections</span><span>)</span></a>?
</p>
<p>Should we deprecate features that are no longer common?
</p>
<p>Should we obsolete outdated RFCs (like 775, 1639) with "Obsoletes:"?
</p>
<p>Should we use old IPR value because we're using old text?
</p>
<p>Are the author listing/credits in compound document done correctly? Some are deceased or inactive or may be otherwise hard to contact.
