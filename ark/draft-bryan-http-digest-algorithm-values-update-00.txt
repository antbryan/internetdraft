Internet-Draft    HTTP Digest Algorithm Values Registry     October 2009


1.  Introduction

   The IANA registry named "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Digest
   Algorithm Values" defines values for digest algorithms used in HTTP.

   This registry was created by [RFC3230] in 2002 and some useful values
   could be added to it.

   [[ Discussion of this draft should take place on IETF HTTP WG mailing
   list at ietf-http-wg@w3.org or directly to the author. ]]

1.1.  Examples

   Examples of Instance Digest for SHA-256:

   Digest: SHA-256=MWVkMWQxYTRiMzk5MDQ0MzI3NGU5NDEyZTk5OWY1ZGFmNzgyZTJlO
   DYzYjRjYzFhOTlmNTQwYzI2M2QwM2U2MQ==


2.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes use of the IANA registry named "Hypertext
   Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Digest Algorithm Values" specified in
   [RFC3230].

   Accordingly, IANA has made the following registrations:

      Digest Algorithm: SHA-224
      Description: The SHA-224 algorithm [SHS].  The output of this
      algorithm is encoded using the base64 encoding [RFC2045].
      Reference: [SHS] [RFC2045]

      Digest Algorithm: SHA-256
      Description: The SHA-256 algorithm [SHS].  The output of this
      algorithm is encoded using the base64 encoding [RFC2045].
      Reference: [SHS] [RFC2045]

      Digest Algorithm: SHA-384
      Description: The SHA-384 algorithm [SHS].  The output of this
      algorithm is encoded using the base64 encoding [RFC2045].
      Reference: [SHS] [RFC2045]

      Digest Algorithm: SHA-512
      Description: The SHA-512 algorithm [SHS].  The output of this
      algorithm is encoded using the base64 encoding [RFC2045].
      Reference: [SHS] [RFC2045]

   Known issues concerning this draft:
   o  Current registry: MD5 lists both RFC1521 and RFC20456 for base64
      encoding.  Should this draft update it to refer to just one?
   o  Current registry: SHA link (
      http://csrc.nist.gov/fips/fip180-1.txt ) is no longer valid.
      Should this draft update it?
   o  If we update SHA in the registry, should this draft refer to SHS
      or RFC3174?

   -00 : September 08, 2009.
   o  Initial draft.
