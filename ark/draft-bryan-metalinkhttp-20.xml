    <section title="Introduction">
      
      <t>Metalink/HTTP is an alternative and complementary representation of Metalink information, which is usually presented as an XML-based document format <xref target="RFC5854"/>. 
      Metalink/HTTP attempts to provide as much functionality as the Metalink/XML format by using existing standards such as Web Linking <xref target="RFC5988"/>, 
      Instance Digests in HTTP <xref target="RFC3230"/>, and Entity Tags (also known as ETags) <xref target="RFC2616"/>. Metalink/HTTP is used to list
      information about a file to be downloaded. This can include lists of multiple URIs (mirrors), Peer-to-Peer information, cryptographic hashes, and digital signatures.</t>
      
      <t>Identical copies of a file are frequently accessible in multiple locations on the Internet over a variety of protocols (such as FTP, HTTP, and Peer-to-Peer).
      In some cases, users are shown a list of these multiple download locations (mirrors) and must manually select a single one on the basis of geographical location, priority, or bandwidth.
      This distributes the load across multiple servers, and should also increase throughput and resilience. At times, however, individual servers can be slow, outdated, or unreachable, but this can not be determined until the download has been initiated. Users will rarely have sufficient information to choose the most appropriate server, and will often choose the first in a list which might not be optimal for their needs, and will lead to a particular server getting a disproportionate share of load.
      The use of suboptimal mirrors can lead to the user canceling and restarting the download to try to manually find a better source. During downloads, errors in transmission can corrupt the file.
      There are no easy ways to repair these files. For large downloads this can be extremely troublesome.
      Any of the number of problems that can occur during a download lead to frustration on the part of users.</t>

      <t>Some popular sites automate the process of selecting mirrors using DNS load balancing, both to approximately balance load between servers, and to direct clients to nearby servers with the hope that this improves throughput.  Indeed, DNS load balancing can balance long-term server load fairly effectively, but it is less effective at delivering the best throughput to users when the bottleneck is not the server but the network.</t>

      <t>This document describes a mechanism by which the benefit of mirrors can be automatically and more effectively realized. All the information about a download, including mirrors, cryptographic hashes, digital signatures, and more can be transferred in coordinated HTTP header fields hereafter referred to as a Metalink.
      This Metalink transfers the knowledge of the download server (and mirror database) to the client. Clients can fallback to other mirrors if the current one has an issue. With this knowledge, 
      the client is enabled to work its way to a successful download even under adverse circumstances. 
      All this can be done without complicated user interaction and the download can be much more reliable and efficient.
      In contrast, a traditional HTTP redirect to a mirror conveys only extremely minimal information - one link to one server, and there is no provision in the HTTP protocol to handle failures.
      Furthermore, in order to provide better load distribution across servers and potentially faster downloads to users, Metalink/HTTP facilitates multi-source downloads, where portions of a file are downloaded from multiple mirrors (and optionally, Peer-to-Peer) simultaneously.</t>

	  <t>Upon connection to a Metalink/HTTP server, a client will receive information about other sources of the same resource and a cryptographic hash of the whole resource. The client will then be able to request chunks of the file from the various sources, scheduling appropriately in order to maximize the download rate.</t>

      <section title="Notational Conventions"> 

	<t>This specification describes conformance of Metalink/HTTP.</t>
     

	<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
	"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
	document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, <xref target="RFC2119"/>, as scoped to those conformance targets.</t>

      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Requirements" anchor="req">
      <t>In this context, "Metalink" refers to Metalink/HTTP which consists of mirrors and cryptographic hashes in HTTP header fields as described in this document. "Metalink/XML" refers to the XML format described in <xref target="RFC5854"/>.</t>
	  
      <t>Metalink resources include Link header fields <xref target="RFC5988"/> to present a list of mirrors in the response to a client request for the resource. Metalink servers MUST include the cryptographic hash of a resource via Instance Digests in HTTP <xref target="RFC3230"/>. Valid algorithms are found in
	  the IANA registry named "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Digest Algorithm Values" at &lt;http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-dig-alg/http-dig-alg.xhtml&gt;. SHA-256 and SHA-512 were added to the registry by <xref target="RFC5843"/>.</t>
	  
	  <t>Metalink servers are HTTP servers with one or more Metalink
 resources. Metalink servers MUST support the Link header fields for listing mirrors and MUST support Instance Digests in HTTP <xref target="RFC3230"/>. Metalink servers MUST return the same Link header fields and Instance Digests on HEAD requests.
      Metalink servers and their associated mirror servers SHOULD all share the same ETag policy. It is up to the administrator of the Metalink server to communicate the details of the shared ETag policy to the administrators of the mirror servers so that the mirror servers can be configured with the same ETag policy. To have the same ETag policy means that ETags are synchronized across servers for resources that are mirrored, i.e. byte-for-byte identical files will have the same ETag on mirrors that they have on the Metalink server. ETags could be based on the file contents (cryptographic hash) and not server-unique filesystem metadata. The emitted ETag could be implemented the same as the Instance Digest for simplicity. Metalink servers SHOULD offer Metalink/XML documents that contain cryptographic hashes of parts of the file (and other information) if error recovery is desirable.</t>

      <t>Mirror servers are typically FTP or HTTP servers that "mirror" another server. That is, they provide identical copies of (at least some) files that are also on the mirrored server. 
      Mirror servers SHOULD support serving partial content. HTTP mirror servers SHOULD share the same ETag policy as the originating Metalink server. HTTP Mirror servers SHOULD support Instance Digests in HTTP <xref target="RFC3230"/> using the same algorithm as the Metalink server.  Optimally, mirror servers will share the same ETag policy and support Instance Digests in HTTP.</t>


      <t>Metalink clients use the mirrors provided by a Metalink server in Link header fields <xref target="RFC5988"/>. Metalink clients MUST support HTTP and SHOULD support FTP <xref target="RFC0959"/>. Metalink clients MAY support BitTorrent <xref target="BITTORRENT"/>, 
      or other download methods. Metalink clients SHOULD switch downloads from one mirror to another if a mirror becomes unreachable. Metalink clients MAY support multi-source, or parallel, 
      downloads, where portions of a file can be downloaded from multiple mirrors simultaneously (and optionally, from Peer-to-Peer sources). Metalink clients MUST support Instance Digests in HTTP <xref target="RFC3230"/> by 
      requesting and verifying cryptographic hashes. Metalink clients SHOULD support error recovery by using the cryptographic hashes of parts of the file listed in Metalink/XML files. Metalink clients SHOULD support checking digital signatures.</t>
	  
	  </section>
	
    <section title="Mirrors / Multiple Download Locations" anchor="mirrors">
      <t>Mirrors are specified with the Link header fields <xref target="RFC5988"/> and a relation type of "duplicate" as defined in <xref target="IANA"/>.</t>

<t><figure> 
	  <preamble>This example shows a brief Metalink server response with two mirrors only:</preamble>	  
	  <artwork type="example">
Link: &lt;http://www2.example.com/example.ext&gt;; rel=duplicate; 
pri=1; pref
Link: &lt;ftp://ftp.example.com/example.ext&gt;; rel=duplicate; 
pri=2; geo=gb; depth=1
</artwork></figure></t>

      <t>As some organizations can have many mirrors, it is up to the organization to configure the amount of Link header fields the Metalink server will provide. Such a decision could be a random selection or a hard-coded limit based on network proximity, file size, server load, or other factors.</t>

<section title="Mirror Priority">
      <t>Entries for mirror servers are listed in order of priority (from most preferred to least) or have a "pri" value, where mirrors with lower values are used first.</t>
      <t>This is purely an expression of the server's preferences; it is up to the client what it does with this information, particularly with reference to how many servers to use at any one time.</t>

</section>

<section title="Mirror Geographical Location">
        <t>Entries for a mirror servers can have a "geo" value, which
        is a <xref target="ISO3166-1"/> alpha-2 two letter country code for the geographical location of the physical server the URI is used
        to access. A client can use this information to select a mirror, or set of mirrors, that are geographically near (if the client has access to such information), with the aim of reducing network load at inter-country bottlenecks.
        </t>
</section>

<section title="Coordinated Mirror Policies" anchor="coordinatedpolicies">
      <t>There are two types of mirror servers: preferred and normal. Preferred mirror servers are HTTP mirror servers that MUST share the same ETag policy as the originating Metalink server and/or MUST provide Instance Digests using the same algorithm as the Metalink server. 
	  Preferred mirrors make it possible to detect early on, before data is transferred, if the file requested matches the desired file.
      Entries for preferred HTTP mirror servers have a "pref" value. By default, if unspecified then mirrors are considered "normal" and do not necessarily share the same ETag policy or support Instance Digests using the same algorithm as the Metalink server.
	  FTP mirrors are considered "normal", as they do not emit ETags or support Instance Digests.</t>
	  
</section>

<section title="Mirror Depth">
      <t>Some mirrors can mirror single files, whole directories, or multiple directories.</t>
      <t>Entries for mirror servers can have a "depth" value, where "depth=0" is the default. A value of 0 means ONLY that file is mirrored and that other URI path segments are not. A value of 1 means that file and all other files and URI path segments contained in the
rightmost URI path segment are mirrored. For values of N, the client will go up N-1 URI path segments above. A value of 2 means means going up one URI path segment above, and all files and URI path segments contained are mirrored. For each higher value, another URI path segment closer to the Host is mirrored.</t>

<t><figure> 
	  <preamble>This example shows a mirror with a depth value of 4:</preamble>	  
	  <artwork type="example">
Link: &lt;http://www2.example.com/dir1/dir2/dir3/dir4/dir5/example.ext&gt;; 
rel=duplicate; pri=1; pref; depth=4
</artwork></figure></t>

      <t>In the above example, 4 URI path segments up are mirrored, from /dir2/ on down.</t>

</section>

	  </section>

    <section title="Peer-to-Peer / Metainfo" anchor="p2p">
      <t>Entries for metainfo files, which describe ways to download a file over Peer-to-Peer networks or otherwise, are specified with the Link header fields <xref target="RFC5988"/> and a relation type of "describedby" and a type parameter that indicates
   the MIME type of the metadata available at the URI. Since metainfo files can sometimes describe multiple files, or the filename may not be the same on the Metalink server and in the metainfo file but still have the same content, an optional name parameter can be used.</t>
<t><figure> 
	  <preamble>This example shows a brief Metalink server response with .torrent and .metalink:</preamble>	
	  <artwork type="example">
Link: &lt;http://example.com/example.ext.torrent&gt;; rel=describedby;
type="application/x-bittorrent"; name="differentname.ext"
Link: &lt;http://example.com/example.ext.metalink&gt;; rel=describedby;
type="application/metalink4+xml"
</artwork></figure></t>

<t>Metalink clients MAY support the use of metainfo files for downloading files.</t>

    <section title="Metalink/XML Files" anchor="metalinkxml">
      <t>Full Metalink/XML files for a given resource can be specified as shown in the example in <xref target="p2p"/>.
      This is particularly useful for providing metadata such as cryptographic hashes of parts of a file, allowing a
      client to recover from errors (see <xref target="errorcorrection"/>). Metalink servers SHOULD provide
	  Metalink/XML files with partial file hashes in Link header fields and Metalink clients SHOULD use them for error recovery.</t>
    </section>
	
    </section>

    <section title="OpenPGP Signatures" anchor="openpgp">
      <t>OpenPGP signatures <xref target="RFC3156"/> are specified with the Link header fields <xref target="RFC5988"/> and a relation type of "describedby" and a type parameter of "application/pgp-signature".</t>
<t><figure> 
	  <preamble>This example shows a brief Metalink server response with OpenPGP signature only:</preamble>

<t>Metalink clients SHOULD support the use of OpenPGP signatures.</t>

    <section title="Cryptographic Hashes of Whole Documents" anchor="wholehashes">
	
	<t>If Instance Digests are not provided by the Metalink servers, the Link header fields pertaining to this specification MUST be ignored.</t>

    <section title="Client / Server Multi-source Download Interaction" anchor="clientserver">
      <t>Metalink clients begin a download with a standard HTTP <xref target="RFC2616"/> GET request to the Metalink server. Metalink clients MAY use a Range limit if desired.</t>
<t><figure> 
	  <artwork type="example">
GET /distribution/example.ext HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
</artwork></figure></t>

<t>The Metalink server responds with the data and these header fields:

<figure> 
	  <artwork type="example">
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 14867603
Content-Type: application/x-cd-image

DYzYjRjYzFhOTlmNTQwYzI2M2QwM2U2MQ==
</artwork></figure></t>

<t>Alternatively, Metalink clients can begin with a HEAD request to the Metalink server to discover mirrors via Link header fields,
 and then skip to making the following decisions on every available mirror server found via the Link header fields.</t>

<t>After that, the client follows with a GET request to the desired mirrors.</t>

<t>From the Metalink server response the client learns some or all of the following metadata
about the requested object, in addition to also starting to receive the
object:</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Mirror profile link, which can describe the mirror's priority, whether it shares the ETag policy of the originating Metalink server, geographical location, and mirror depth.</t>
<t>Instance Digest, which is the whole file cryptographic hash.</t>
<t>ETag.</t>
<t>Object size from the Content-Length header field.</t>
<t>Metalink/XML, which can include partial file cryptographic hashes to repair a file.</t>
<t>Peer-to-peer information.</t>
<t>Digital signature.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Next, the Metalink client requests a Range of the object from a preferred mirror server, so it can use If-Match conditions:

<figure> 
	  <artwork type="example">
GET /example.ext HTTP/1.1
Host: www2.example.com
Range: bytes=7433802-
If-Match: "thvDyvhfIqlvFe+A9MYgxAfm1q5="
Referer: http://www.example.com/distribution/example.ext
</artwork></figure></t>

<t>Here, the preferred mirror server has the correct file (the If-Match conditions match) and responds with a 206 Partial Content HTTP status code and appropriate "Content-Length", "Content Range", ETag, and Instance Digest header fields. In this example, the mirror server responds, with data, to the above request:

<figure> 
	  <artwork type="example">
HTTP/1.1 206 Partial Content
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 7433801
Content-Range: bytes 7433802-14867602/14867603
Etag: "thvDyvhfIqlvFe+A9MYgxAfm1q5="
Digest: SHA-256=MWVkMWQxYTRiMzk5MDQ0MzI3NGU5NDEyZTk5OWY1ZGFmNzgyZTJlO
DYzYjRjYzFhOTlmNTQwYzI2M2QwM2U2MQ==
</artwork></figure></t>

<t>If the object is large and gets delivered slower than expected, then the Metalink client MAY start a number of parallel ranged downloads (one per selected mirror server other than the
first) using mirrors provided by the Link header fields with "duplicate" relation type. Metalink clients SHOULD use the location of the original GET request in the "Referer" header field for
these ranged requests.</t>

<t>The Metalink client can determine the size and number of ranges requested from each server, based upon the type and number of mirrors and performance observed from each mirror.
Note that Range requests impose an overhead on servers and clients need to be aware of that and not abuse them. Metalink clients SHOULD NOT make more than one concurrent Range request to
each mirror server that it downloads from.</t>

<t>Metalink clients SHOULD close all but the fastest connection if any Ranged requests generated after the first request end up with a complete response, instead of a partial response
(as some mirrors might not support HTTP ranges), if the goal is the fastest transfer. Metalink clients MAY monitor mirror conditions and dynamically switch between mirrors to achieve the fastest download possible. Similarly, Metalink clients SHOULD abort extremely slow or stalled range requests and finish the request on
other mirrors. If all ranges have finished except for the final one, the Metalink client can split the final range into multiple range requests to other mirrors so the transfer finishes faster.</t>

<t>If the first request was GET and no Range header field was sent and
 the client determines later that it will issue a Range request, then the client
 SHOULD close the first connection when it catches up with the other parallel ranged downloads of the same object. This means the first connection was
 sacrificed. Metalink clients can use a HEAD request first, if
 possible, so that the client can find out if there are any Link
 header fields, and then Range-based requests are undertaken to
 the mirror servers without sacrificing a first connection.</t>

<t>Preferred mirrors have coordinated ETags, as described in <xref target="coordinatedpolicies"/>, and Metalink clients SHOULD use If-Match conditions based on the ETag to quickly 
detect out-of-date mirrors by using the ETag from the Metalink server response. 
Optimally, the mirror server will include an Instance Digest in the mirror response to the client GET request, which the client can also use to detect a mismatch early. If the mirror did not include
the pref parameter or an Instance Digest, then a mismatch can not be 
detected until the completed object is verified. Early file mismatch detection is described in detail in <xref target="earlyfilemismatchdetection"/>.</t>

<t>Metalink clients MUST reject downloads from mirrors where the file size does not match the file size as reported by the Metalink server.</t>

<t>Metalink clients MUST reject downloads from mirrors that support Instance Digests if the Instance Digest from the mirror does not match the Instance Digest as reported by the Metalink server and the same algorithm is used.</t>

<t>If a Metalink client does not
support certain download methods (such as FTP or BitTorrent) that a
file is available from, and there are no available download methods
that the client supports, then the download will have no way to
complete.</t>

<t>Metalink clients MUST verify the cryptographic hash of the file once the download has completed. If the cryptographic hash offered by the Metalink server with Instance Digests
does not match the cryptographic hash
of the downloaded file, see <xref target="errorcorrection"/> for a possible way to repair errors.</t>

<t>If the download can not be repaired, it is considered corrupt. The client can attempt to re-download the file.</t>

<section title="Error Prevention, Detection, and Correction">

<t>Error prevention, or early file mismatch detection, is possible before file transfers with the use of file sizes, ETags, and Instance Digests provided by Metalink servers. Error detection requires Instance Digests
to detect errors in transfer after the transfers have completed. Error correction, or download repair, is possible with partial file cryptographic hashes.</t>

<t>Note that cryptographic hashes obtained from Instance Digests are in base64 encoding, while those from Metalink/XML are in hexadecimal.</t>

<section title="Error Prevention (Early File Mismatch Detection)" anchor="earlyfilemismatchdetection">

<t>In HTTP terms, the merging of ranges from multiple
responses can be verified with a strong validator, which in this
context is either an Instance Digest or a shared ETag.
In most cases, it is sufficient that the Metalink server provides
mirrors and Instance Digest information, but operation will be
more robust and efficient if the mirror servers do implement a shared
ETag policy or Instance Digests as well. There is no need to specify how the ETag is generated, just that it needs to be shared between the Metalink server and the mirror servers.
The benefit of having mirror servers return an Instance Digest is that the client then can detect
mismatches early even if ETags are not used. Mirrors that support both a shared ETag and Instance Digests do provide value, but just one is sufficient for early
detection of mismatches. If the mirror server provides neither shared ETag nor Instance Digest, then early detection of
mismatches is not possible unless file length also differs. Finally, errors are still detectable after the download has completed, when the cryptographic hash of the merged response is verified.</t>

<t>ETags can not be used for verifying the integrity of the received
content. But it is a guarantee issued by the Metalink server that the content is
correct for that ETag. And if the ETag given by the mirror server matches
the ETag given by the Metalink server, then there is a chain of trust where the Metalink server
authorizes these responses as valid for that object.</t>

<t>This guarantees that a mismatch will be detected by using only the shared
ETag from a Metalink server and mirror server.
Mirror servers will respond
with an error if ETags do not match, which will prevent accidental merges of ranges from different
versions of files with the same name.</t>

<t>A shared ETag or Instance Digest can not strictly protect against malicious attacks or server or
network errors replacing content.
An attacker can make a mirror server seemingly respond with the expected Instance Digest or ETags even if the file
contents have been modified. The same goes
for various system failures which would also cause bad data (i.e. corrupted files) to be returned. The Metalink client
has to rely on the Instance Digest returned by the Metalink server in the
first response for the verification of the downloaded object as a whole.</t>

</section>

<section title="Error Correction" anchor="errorcorrection">

<t>Partial file cryptographic hashes can be used to detect errors during the download. Metalink servers SHOULD provide Metalink/XML files with partial file hashes 
in Link header fields as specified in <xref target="metalinkxml"/>, and Metalink clients SHOULD use them for error correction.</t>

<t>If the cryptographic hash of the object does not match the Instance Digest from the Metalink server, then the client SHOULD fetch the Metalink/XML (if available)
that could contain partial file cryptographic hashes which
will allow detection of which mirror server returned incorrect data.
Metalink clients SHOULD figure out what ranges of
the downloaded data can be recovered and what needs to be fetched again.
</t>

<t>Other methods can be used for error correction. For example, some other metainfo files also include partial file hashes that can be used to check for errors.</t>

	<section title="IANA Considerations" anchor="IANA">

	<t>Accordingly, IANA will make the following registration to the Link Relation Type registry at &lt;http://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml&gt;.</t>
	
<t>o  Relation Name: duplicate</t>
<t>o  Description: Refers to a resource whose available representations are byte-for-byte identical with the corresponding representations of the context IRI.</t>
<t>o  Reference: This specification.</t>
<t>o  Notes: This relation is for static resources. That is, an HTTP GET request on any duplicate will return the same representation. It does not make sense for dynamic or POSTable resources and should not be used for them.</t>


	</section>

	  <section title="Security Considerations">

	    <section title="URIs and IRIs">

	      <t>Metalink clients handle URIs and IRIs. See Section 7 of <xref target="RFC3986"/> and Section 8 of <xref target="RFC3987"/> for security
          considerations related to their handling and use.</t>

	    </section>

	    <section title="Spoofing">

	      <t>There is potential for spoofing attacks where the attacker publishes Metalinks with false information.
          In that case, this could deceive unaware downloaders into downloading a malicious or worthless file. As with all downloads, users should only download from trusted sources. Also, malicious publishers could attempt a distributed denial of service attack by inserting unrelated URIs into Metalinks.</t>

	    </section>	
		
	    <section title="Cryptographic Hashes">

	      <t>Currently, some of the digest values defined in Instance Digests in HTTP <xref target="RFC3230"/> are considered insecure. 
          These include the whole Message Digest family of algorithms which are not suitable for cryptographically strong verification. Malicious people could provide files that appear to be 
          identical to another file because of a collision, i.e. the weak cryptographic hashes of the intended file and a substituted malicious file could match.</t>
          <t>If a Metalink contains whole file hashes as described in <xref target="wholehashes"/>, it SHOULD include SHA-256, as specified in <xref target="FIPS-180-3"/>, or stronger. It MAY also include other hashes.</t>

	    </section>	
		
		
	    <section title="Signing">

	      <t>Metalinks SHOULD include digital signatures, as described in <xref target="openpgp"/>.</t>

	      <t>Digital signatures provide authentication, message integrity, and non-repudiation with proof of origin.</t>

<title>Additional Hash Algorithms for HTTP Instance Digests</title>
<author initials='A.' surname='Bryan' fullname='A. Bryan'>
<organization /></author>
<date year='2010' month='April' />
<abstract>
<t>The IANA registry named "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Digest Algorithm Values" defines values for digest algorithms used by Instance Digests in HTTP.  Instance Digests in HTTP provide a digest, also known as a checksum or hash, of an entire representation of the current state of a resource.  This document adds new values to the registry and updates previous values.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t></abstract></front>

		<t>This draft, compared to the Metalink/XML format <xref target="RFC5854"/> :</t>
        <t>
	    <list style="symbols">

	      <t>(+) Reuses existing HTTP standards without much new besides a Link Relation Type. It's more of a collection/coordinated feature set.</t>
		  <t>(?) The existing standards don't seem to be widely implemented.</t>
	      <t>(+) No XML dependency, except for Metalink/XML for partial file cryptographic hashes.</t>
		  <t>(+) Existing Metalink/XML clients can be easily converted to support this as well.</t>
	      <t>(+) Coordination of mirror servers is preferred, but not required. Coordination could be difficult or impossible unless one group is in control of all servers on the mirror network.</t>
	      <t>(-) Requires software or configuration changes to originating server.</t>
		  <t>(-?) Tied to HTTP, not as generic. FTP/P2P clients won't be using it unless they also support HTTP, unlike Metalink/XML.</t>
	      <t>(-) Requires server-side support. Metalink/XML can be created by user (or server, but server component/changes not required).</t>
		  <t>(-) Also, Metalink/XML files are easily mirrored on all servers. Even if usage in that case is not as transparent, this method still gives access to all download information (with no changes needed to servers) from all mirrors (FTP included).</t>
	      <t>(-) Not portable/archivable/emailable. Metalink/XML is used to import/export transfer queues. Not as easy for search engines to index?</t>
	      <t>(-) Not as rich metadata.</t>
	      <t>(-) Not able to add multiple files to a download queue or create directory structure.</t>
