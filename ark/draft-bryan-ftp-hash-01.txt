Abstract

   The File Transfer Protocol does not offer any method to verify the
   integrity of a transferred file, nor can two files be compared
   against each other without actually transferring them first.
   Cryptographic hashes are a possible solution to this problem.  In the
   past, several attempts have been made to add commands to obtain
   checksums and hashes, however none have been formally specified,
   leading to non-interoperability and confusion.  To solve these
   issues, this document specifies a new FTP command to be used by
   clients to request cryptographic hashes of files.

Internet-Draft   FTP Extensions for Cryptographic Hashes      April 2010


1.  Introduction

   The File Transfer Protocol [RFC0959] does not offer any method to
   verify the integrity of a transferred file, nor can two files be
   compared against each other without actually transferring them first.
   Cryptographic hashes are a possible solution to this problem.  In the
   past, several attempts have been made to add commands to obtain
   checksums and hashes, however none have been formally specified,
   leading to non-interoperability and confusion.  To solve these
   issues, this document specifies a new FTP command to be used by
   clients to request cryptographic hashes of files.  HTTP has a similar
   feature named Instance Digests [RFC3230] which allows a client to
   request the cryptographic hash of a file.

   [[ Discussion of this draft should take place on
   apps-discuss@ietf.org. ]]

1.1.  Examples

   Example of HASH client request:

           HASH filename.ext

   HASH server response with Positive Completion code and the requested
   hash using the currently selected algorithm:

           213 80bc95fd391772fa61c91ed68567f0980bb45fd9


2.  Notational Conventions

   This specification describes conformance of FTP Extensions for
   cryptographic hashes.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119], as
   scoped to those conformance targets.

   This document also uses notation defined in STD 9, [RFC0959].

   Syntax required is defined using the Augmented BNF defined in
   [RFC5234].


3.  The HASH Command (HASH)

   The HASH command allows for requesting the cryptographic hash of a

   file.

   The syntax for the HASH command is:


           hash = "HASH" SP <pathname>

   As with all FTP commands, the "HASH" command label is interpreted in
   a case-insensitive manner.

   The HASH command keyword MUST be followed by a single space (ASCII
   32) followed by the pathname.

   The pathname argument should reference the same file as other file
   based commands such as STOR or RETR which the same argument would
   reference.

   The text returned in response to the HASH command MUST be:


           hash-response = "213" SP 1*HEXDIGIT CRLF

   All hash values MUST be encoded in lowercase hexadecimal format.

   The standard negative error codes 500 and 501 are sufficient to
   handle all errors involving the HASH command (e.g., syntax errors).
   Response code 550 is used if the file can not be found.  Response
   code 552 is used if the user isn't allowed to use the HASH command.
   Response code 450 is used to indicate the server is busy, e.g.
   already hashing other files yet inviting the client to retry in
   future.

   The HASH command is useful for files transmitted in Image type mode
   (TYPE I) and Stream transfer mode (MODE S).

3.1.  FEAT response for HASH

   A server that supports HASH should advertise it in FEAT response
   [RFC2389] with a list of all supported hash algorithms in a semicolon
   separated list.  The hash algorithm that is currently selected is
   marked with an asterisk.  In the example below, the "C>" lines are
   commands from user-PI to server-PI, the "S>" lines are server-PI
   replies.

           C> feat
           S> 211-Extensions supported:
           S>  SIZE
           S>  COMPRESSION
           S>  HASH SHA-1*;MD5
           S>  MDTM
           S> 211 END

   The IANA registry named "Hash Function Textual Names" defines values
   for hash types.  Hash names should be presented in uppercase, but
   comparisons should be case-insensitive, e.g.  MD5, md5, Md5 are all
   the same.


           hash-feat = SP "HASH" SP hashlist CRLF
           hashlist = 1*( hashname ["*"] ";" )
           hashtype = 1*( hchar )
           hchar = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "_" / "/" / "." / ","


3.2.  Changing the HASH algorithm

   To query the current hash algorithm and to change it, the OPTS
   command as defined in [RFC2389] is used with HASH as the first
   argument.  If no second argument is passed, OPTS HASH simply returns
   the currently selected hash algorithm.  To change the algorithm, a
   valid hashtype has to be given as second argument.  If the command is
   successful, all future calls to HASH until the next successful OPTS
   HASH command or until the session is reinitialized (REIN) will use
   the selected hash algorithm.


           C> OPTS HASH
           S> 200 SHA-1
           C> OPTS HASH SHA-512
           S> 200 SHA-512
           C> OPTS HASH CRC-37
           S> 501 Unknown algorithm, current selection not changed


           hashopts-cmd = "OPTS HASH" [ SP hashtype ] CRLF
           hashopts-response = "200" SP hashtype CRLF


4.  Command Usage

   Client requests the cryptographic hash of a file with HASH command.
   Server replies with cryptographic hash of file.  Client downloads

   file.  Client hashes the downloaded file and compares its hash to the
   hash obtained from the server.  This command could also be used to
   verify that an uploaded file is an exact copy.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This new command is added to the "FTP Commands and Extensions"
   registry created by [RFC5797].

   Command Name: HASH

   Description: Cryptographic Hash of a file

   FEAT String: HASH

   Command Type: Service execution

   Conformance Requirements: Optional

   Reference: This specification


6.  Implementation Requirements

   All conforming implementations MUST at least support the SHA-1
   algorithm.  Implementations SHOULD NOT make any algorithm the default
   that is known to be weaker than SHA-1.  Support for any additional
   algorithms is optional.


7.  Security Considerations

   Calculating a file's hash is a CPU intensive operation and can easily
   consume the available disk I/O resources.  If the HASH command isn't
   implemented carefully, a server could be vulnerable to a denial of
   service attack.  On an affected server a malicious user could, for
   example, continuously send HASH commands over multiple connections
   and thus consume most of the FTP server's CPU and disk I/O resources,
   leaving little room for other operations.  To mitigate this risk, a
   server SHOULD cache the calculated hashes so that the hash of a file
   is only calculated once even if multiple hash requests are sent for
   that file.

   The performance of commonly used hard disk drives is adversely
   affected by the amount of time the device needs to reposition its
   read-and-write heads.  A server SHOULD therefore avoid hashing
   multiple files at the same time which are located on the same



Bryan, et al.            Expires October 9, 2010                [Page 6]

   physical media and SHOULD instead hash them sequentially.  A possible
   solution is to use the 450 reply code of HASH to indicate that the
   server is already busy with another HASH operation.

   In addition, the HASH command can be used to draw conclusions about
   the contents of a file.  If the hash of a file on some server matches
   the hash of some known, local file, both files are likely identical.
   To prevent this scenario it suffices to limit use of the HASH command
   to users who would already be able to download the file.
