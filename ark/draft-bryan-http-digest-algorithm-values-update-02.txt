Internet-Draft  More Algorithms for HTTP Instance Digests   October 2009


1.  Introduction

   The IANA registry named "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Digest
   Algorithm Values" defines values for digest algorithms used in HTTP.

   Note: This is unrelated to HTTP Digest Authentication.

   The registry was created by [RFC3230] in 2002.  This draft adds new
   values to the registry and updates previous values which had
   redundant or outdated references.

   [[ Discussion of this draft should take place on IETF HTTP WG mailing
   list at ietf-http-wg@w3.org or directly to the author. ]]

1.1.  Examples

   Examples of Instance Digest for SHA-256:

   Digest: SHA-256=MWVkMWQxYTRiMzk5MDQ0MzI3NGU5NDEyZTk5OWY1ZGFmNzgyZTJlO
   DYzYjRjYzFhOTlmNTQwYzI2M2QwM2U2MQ==


2.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes use of the IANA registry named "Hypertext
   Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Digest Algorithm Values" specified in
   [RFC3230].

2.1.  Previous Registrations Updated

   Accordingly, IANA has updated the following registrations:

      Digest Algorithm: MD5
      Description: The MD5 algorithm, as specified in [RFC1321].  The
      output of this algorithm is encoded using the base64 encoding
      [RFC4648].
      Reference: [RFC1321] [RFC4648]

      Digest Algorithm: SHA
      Description: The SHA-1 algorithm [FIPS-180-3].  The output of this
      algorithm is encoded using the base64 encoding [RFC4648].
      Reference: [FIPS-180-3] [RFC4648]

2.2.  New Registrations

   Accordingly, IANA has made the following registrations:

Internet-Draft  More Algorithms for HTTP Instance Digests   October 2009


      Digest Algorithm: SHA-256
      Description: The SHA-256 algorithm [FIPS-180-3].  The output of
      this algorithm is encoded using the base64 encoding [RFC4648].
      Reference: [FIPS-180-3] [RFC4648]

      Digest Algorithm: SHA-512
      Description: The SHA-512 algorithm [FIPS-180-3].  The output of
      this algorithm is encoded using the base64 encoding [RFC4648].
      Reference: [FIPS-180-3] [RFC4648]


3.  Security Considerations

   Same as [RFC3230].


4.  Changes compared to RFC3230

   All previous values to the registry are still valid.

   The reference for base64 encoding has been updated for both MD5 and
   SHA.

   The reference for SHA has been updated.
